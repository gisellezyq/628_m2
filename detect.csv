64,1,"Wir waren diesen Samstag (19.09) mal wieder im Pilum. Eine gute Lage, ausreichend Parkplätze und schönes Ambiente (Innen wie Außen). Für Damen in feinem Schuhwerk ist die Terasse etwas von Nachteil, man sitzt entweder auf Sandboden oder feinem Kiesel, beides sehr unangenehm in Tussiletten ;-)


 Die Bude war voll, eine Hochzeitsgesellschaft hat sich in den Räumlichkeiten ausgebreitet, trotzdem war eine Bedienung sofort zur Stelle und hat unsere Bestellung aus der übersichtlichen Speisekarte aufgenommen. Lustigerweise wusste sie nicht, von welcher Brauerei die angebotenen Biere stammen. Die Dame war sehr nett aber total verpeilt.


 Nachdem unsere Getränke geliefert wurden kam eine weitere Bedienung und erklärte uns höflich dass es aufgrund der Hochzeit mit dem Essen ""ein paar Minuten"" länger dauern könne, das Buffet wäre eben erst eröffnet worden.


 Ca. 1 Stunde später kam das erste Essen, die Bedienung musste sich aber erst durch unsere Nachbartische fragen da sie die Tischnummer wohl vergessen hat. Die Tomaten auf Hünchenfilet und Bandnudeln waren sehr lecker.


 20 Minuten nach dem Hühnchen hat sich ein Rumpsteak mit Salat an unseren Tisch verirrt, wieder mit hilfe der Nachbartische.


 Ca. 20 Minuten später kommt wieder ein Kellner und erklärt uns es gäbe keine Knoblauchbutter für die Steaks mehr, alternativ würde es aber einen Knoblauch-Kräuter-Quark geben. Wir akzeptieren natürlich.


 Weitere 10 Minuten später kommt das Schweinesteak mit dem Quark, aber ""mit"" ohne Knoblauch oder Kräuter. Einfach nur Quark.


 Nach weiteren 20 Minuten kommt mein Rumpsteak, ohne Knoblauchbutter, ohne Quark, ohne Kommentar. Das Fleisch war gut, die Pommes alt, kalt und ungesalzen. Extra Salz oder Pfefferstreuer gab es keine.


 Wieso die Küche (auch bei Stress) nicht 2 bestellte Rumpsteaks gleichzeitig in die Pfanne hauen kann sondern mit knappen 50 Minuten versatz brät, konnte mir auch die Bedienung nicht erklären. Ich war aber schon froh das sie den Weg zum Tisch gefunden hat, damit wir bezahlen konnten.",1326,5

95,1,Une soirée gâchée. J'étais à la recherche d'un bon steak house et je suis tombé sur cet endroit qui est un genre de casa grec en plus mauvais encore. J'ai eu le malheur de choisir un plat de moules. Le cuisinier (dans une tentative de faire une mauvaise blague?) avait foutu une salade par-dessus les moules pour ensuite les faire gratiner avec fromage fêta. Le tout donnait un mélange raté qui ne ressemblait à rien de connu sur cette planète. Ma bien-aimée à eu droit à une brochette de bœuf accompagnée de frites tièdes. Le tout pour une facture de 70$. Le décors est une mauvaise imitation de ranch entremêlé des restants de l'ancien resto qui devait être portugais à juger par les peintures aux murs. C'est vraiment n'importe quoi !,6424,4

Granted you know the healthy food diners will cost more but really? $9.99 for three multi-grain pancakes with only two strawberries sliced 10 ways to give appearance of more? Menu photo showed blueberries, strawberries, and bananas! After receiving my order that was obviously missing a great deal, I walked up to menu board on wall. In small print description I read only strawberries mentioned. After tax and tip we're talking $13 for three multi-grain hot cakes with two strawberries? And yes, I tip knowing it isn't employees fault the owners boards are misleading.  Felt scammed and never going back.",134,5
103,1,"Time for someone to tell the truth about the Duce. Before today, even I had given it 3 stars because I wanted to give it a chance. No more.

The Duce gets one star for numerous reasons: 

1. In an effort to be retro-cool, its beer list is comprised exclusively of crap you would drink at a dive bar in Chicago, in the 1970s. And I can appreciate that, and even favor it. But at least offer us a choice. This is the American West. Many of us will drink PBR once in our lifetimes for kicks, conclude that it tastes like carbonated piss (which it absolutely does), and promptly go back to our Kiltlifters and Fat Tires. 

2. I live in the neighborhood, just blocks away from Chase Field. I am 100% judgmental of baseball fans who live here but cheer for any visiting team, and rest assured that I'm in very good company as a downtowner. Anyone in tune with how our city works knows that this is a major pet peeve of its long-time residents. So, I can only conclude that the Duce is out of tune with us on this point, too: it advertises itself as a venue friendly to *another* team in the National League that I refuse to name here. Strike 2.

3. A friend texted me not too long ago to say that he and his girlfriend were in my neighborhood to check out the Duce on a Saturday morning, and would I care to join them for breakfast? Before I could answer, I got another text: ""wtf! It's closed!"" The Duce has horrendous, laughable hours. Right now it doesn't even bother opening on Mondays, Tuesdays or Wednesdays at all. On the 4 days of the week it's open, it still shuts down at 10 pm on two of them, and even earlier on Sunday. Therefore, I have no reason to go there to enjoy what should be the cool bar scene. (Setting aside its atrocious beer selection.) 

As much as I initially liked the concept of the Duce as described by its owners in the media, it has been poorly executed from what I've seen so far. Get rid of the anti-Dbacks status, create a better bar situation for people to enjoy in terms of drink selection and hours, and it might stand a chance in the long run.",2820,3

I had promised my kids a treat from Carlos' Bakery but the line was huge, so we decided to get a table here instead & have dessert & drinks. It was around 3:30 & as it was between lunch & dinner the restaurant was mostly empty. The hostess informed us that since we weren't actually eating a meal she couldn't seat us at a table reserved for people who were eating a meal.  Hmmm, in a mostly empty restaurant. We would have had a few cocktails each as well as desserts, & we always tip well because regardless of how much or little we eat, the staff still has to do their job. So I guess my one star rating is for the hostess. Maybe we'll be back some day...",3966,3

154,1,"Merry-Ann's Diner is a truck stop style 24 hour breakfast diner. Unfortunately, Merry-Ann's is not very good. I can't recommend it.

Merry-Ann's menu, decor and layout, and overall look and feel, are identical to that of a Waffle House franchise. I suspect that this diner was designed to duplicate the successful Waffle House model. 

All of the menu items, from the coffee, eggs, and omelets down to toast and sweet rolls, are poor, although some items are a notch better, namely mediocre. 

Service is roughly comparable to that of other Waffle House stores. Ditto for the decor, and, in fact, the actual floor layout.

Prices are low in absolute terms but they are somewhat high for the types of menu selections offered, quality aside. (And the quality delivered is mostly poor.)

Before the Hilton-Garden Inn took over the property across the street, there was a well-regarded breakfast restaurant, almost a Champaign institution, attached to the property. The Hilton razed the restaurant as part of its renovation. Too bad. The Merry-Ann Diner is not suitable for breakfast at any time of day.",1513,3

Also witnessed an employee go out for a smoke break and then go back to work without stopping to wash her hands. Yuck.",2593,5
164,1,"Considering it's in a strip mall in the parking lot of a Super Target, I entered The Flying Hound with low expectations. But hunger and a crunch for time will make any place worthy of a try. Quite honestly, a stop at the Target food counter would've been more satisfying (albeit more shameful). The interior is decorated with some World Market prints and beer signs to make it feel like a faux pub. A thin veneer without anything to show underneath it. This carries forward to the food. The ""signature"" (their words) pork schnitzel sandwich was completely underwhelming. Evidently they lost the ""pounded thin"" aspect of schnitzel in translation. What I received was basically a breaded boneless pork chop accompanied with a slice of halfway melted muenster cheese and wilted arugula. The house onion gravy that accompanied it was separated by the time it came tableside. The sandwich was completely devoid of any flavor.  My daughter went with the grilled cheese. On paper, a combo of muenster and cheddar with a roasted garlic spread sounds solid, but sadly this isn't paper and the sandwich was nothing to write home about. The accompanying fries were undersalted and bland. 
Yes, I know that the under represented southwest side of Madison is in need of a regular ""go-to"" place for good drink and food. There isn't much around nearby and they are desperately in need. But sadly, The Flying Hound comes nowhere close to delivering  They are counting on convenience of proximity to bring in the crowds.

I looked at the menu and it's actually cheaper by 5 cents if you order a dozen from the menu. Had the oysters here before and it was hit or miss, some were way too small. Food price is overinflated. Food is just meh, for the price not worth it. Much rather go to seafood buffet or oyster bar at palace station at least you're getting your money's worth for way much more delicious seafood.

270,1,"The food tasted really well. There's a huge selection of different hot dogs with varying toppings not to mention the wide assortment of poutines. I tried the Coney Dog that included the homemade chili, onions, and mustard, but I substituted the beef hot dog for a turkey sausage which made for a great combination. 

I was still a little hungry and contemplated ordering the poutine but decided to keep it 'somewhat clean' so I ordered a beef hot dog without the bun. That's when it all went downhill from there. The grill man, who was also preparing the toppings on the hot dogs and was preparing the poutine with his hands, picked up the washroom key to hand to a customer and then proceeded to work WITHOUT replacing his gloves. 

I'm sorry but I personally handle any washroom key with triple paper towel after washing my hands. This gentleman, who's the cook and food handler at this establishment, has a responsibilty to adhere to the most basic hygiene practices comsidering his role in a kitchen. But no, the clear gloves are just for show, touch the washroon key, then proceed to touch food with your hands as usual.

I seldomly write reviews, am typically very easy to satisfy, and am usually not phased by any sort of nonesense. But when it comes to health and hygiene, I'm sorry but there's no leniency in that regard. It's the most basic of human responsibilities, yet some just don't seem to get it. 

Would've gave this establishment 4 stars, instead, I won't even return. And will pass the information to others if I were to be asked for their own information. Someone may say it's just one bad seed, so don't be so hard on the establishment. Maybe they'd be right, however, it takes only one bad seed to leave a bad taste in your mouth.",2893,3

I'd expected some high quality Chinese food but instead I ended up having Panda Express like food for $$$$ price. 

1) They charge $8 for bottled water; No wonder they didn't even tell me about regular water option and kept asking me if I want more bottled water. 
2) Wanting to try some of the chef's special, I ordered two of their spring tasting menu which is $50/person. Their food serving timing was way off. After having the starter, corn soup, my party had to wait 10 min to get the next entry. The main dish was one small lobster and pieces of beef and chicken lined up on one big plate. The lobster and beef was decent, but the chicken was comparable to the orange chicken from Panda Express.

The dessert was good though. With two glasses of wine which is $10/person and tips, the final bill was $150 for two people. My girlfriend even said we should tell them their food sucks. In summary, I recommend you to opt for other better restaurants in Vegas or just get decent priced entries since this restaurant is no special.",999,3

As a ""bistro"" I think it really needs a lot of work. It's really pricey, and typically they'll staff one or two waiters for the entire establishment. I've gone a couple of times now (once for dinner, once for brunch) and both times the server's ""section"" was way too much for one person. 

Every table was waiting at least an hour for food, the kitchen kept screwing up orders (one of our friends got her food after we'd all finished), and the price just doesn't justify the cold and kind of ""Meh, I'd eat it"" food. 

Our servers both times were a really nice people, and very apologetic, but their management (or lack thereof) is really screwing them. They just aren't getting the support staff they need, and the kitchen can't handle a full house.

Gravy out of a can has more flavor. The scallops were pretty good but two for $15 is nuts. Seriously? Two? Way out of line. The goat cheese and pesto stuffed flatbread had way too much goat cheese. I know that sounds crazy but it's true. I love cheese. I could live on cheese. This had too much. And, I'm pretty sure the marinara they put on the flatbread was Ragu or Prego. Pathetic. They almost scored gold with the anchovies but they ruined the dish with a whopping gob of gross mayo. The service was great. We sat at the bar and ate. Bartenders were friendly and kept the wine and food coming. Wine selection was great, too. Unfortunately, neither the service or wine could make up for the terrible food. This place is living on location alone.",8132,3
475,1,"It has been 6 months or so since I've been to a Taco Bell.  Now I remember why.  This one was particularly bad.  I got a 1/2-lb. beef combo burrito, nacho cheese gordita, and a large soda.  
The name ""beef"" combo burrito is a misnomer; this thing had 1/4-lb. of sour cream in it, and the rest was refried beans.  There couldn't have been more than 5 little granules of ground beef in this crappy thing.

My order was $7.07 for two items and a soda.  I used to go to Taco Bell in California and get the same order for about $5.00.  I don't know what is going on at this place, but I'll never go back.",4409,5

I ordered a decaf iced latte, and handed my card to the employee. He put my credit card in the chip reader and then walked off and didn't come back so I had to reach over and grab my card out of the chip reader. 

One minute later, he hollers over the counter, what did you order again? So I said, ""A decaf iced latte."" Then he nodded and went back to supposidly make my coffee. Nope, he comes back and says, I forgot again, what did you want? - ""A decaf iced latte.""

Thought that was the end but nope, he asked one more time if I wanted decaf or regular.

It still wasn't good then, so either the giant stack of bread that was sitting in the store shelves was baked a day or two ago or their bread just stinks. It was probably the former.

The entry inside the restaurant was full of their dead bodies.  The inside was never very clean looking and I often questioned the looks of the kitchen.   Needless to say, I've never been back nor did my appetite get restored that day.  It made me wonder if I was a star on that show ""Bizzare Foods with Andrew Zimmern"".  God help me.  The staff was never very friendly or clean looking and the carpet was full of grease stains and if you weren't carefull, you would slip on the floor covered in grease.  So as soon as we discovered the millions of dead cockroaches, we made an about face and left.  We went to Applebees next door but I didn't end up eating lunch that day.

Literally crawling, not moving too fast, seeming to be coming from a drain in the floor. What the hell? You mean the staff washes their hands in here?

625,1,"Four Hours of my life I'd like to have back!

The food...3 stars; Loud, uncool music... Negative 1 star; Not honoring a reservation made 2 months in advance until an hour after the reservation time...Negative 1 star; Taking a reservation for 12, when not a table in the place is big enough for comfortably sit 8...Negative 1 star.

OK, I won't be going back to STK.  

It's way too loud for anything except a dance club, let alone a (theoretical) steak restaurant...they're trying too hard to be cool.  This means not even a two person table could have a diner conversation; but if a dinner date without talking is for you, then this could be the place.  Might as well bring earplugs...the 80s music isn't worth listening to anyway.

Not a place for large parties.  I planned on a nice dinner with a group of friends and celebrating a birthday.  Shame on STK for even taking a reservation for 12 and confirming it 24 hours ahead of time, if the restaurant isn't set up for large groups.  Almost all of the tables are fixed booths, so there's no re-arranging...and the booths are pretty much 6 to 8 people comfortably.  It would have been nice to have known, before everyone is sitting in each other's lap for an expensive dinner.

It was Margarita Monday.  The margaritas were not very good.  Then we wanted a couple of appetizers to share.  I asked our server if they had a chili con queso dip and chips.  She said that they did not.  We ordered Nando's nachos and a cheese crisp.  The nachos had ""queso dip"" poured all over the top.  They couldn't throw some in a bowl with chips??  Both items weren't that great.  We got a 2nd round of margaritas.  Didn't even get a buzz....tasted so much margarita mix - needed more tequila.

680,1,"I recently had a traumatizing experience here which completely threw me off.

My boyfriend and I stopped in to pick up some burgers for lunch. He ordered the special of the day, some sort of beefy thing with cheese, avocado, refried beans and jalapeno salsa. Of the two veggie options on the menu -- one made with a soy patty and one with a portobello mushroom -- I opted for the ""AK-Veggie 7"". 

We ordered the burgers to go, being in a bit of a rush, and waited for what seemed like a lengthy amount of time before finally receiving a big paper bag with our food. I was starving and could hardly wait to get home and eat my burger. Turned out the burger boxes were mislabelled, and in my ravenous state I bit into what I THOUGHT was the veggie burger, only to discover it was meat. I then proceeded to alternate between throwing up violently and crying uncontrollably (fine, I threw up once and shed a couple of tears). Thank you, Burgernator, for providing me my first taste of meat in 10+ years -- against my will. Why even bother offering not just one, but TWO veggie options if your staff won't even take the time and consideration to label your boxes correctly?

Strangely enough, the other burger (what I assume is the REAL veggie burger) had a tiny dollop of guacamole on top, one tomato and several leaves of mixed greens, even though the menu advertises the AK-Veggie 7 as containing pickles. IN ADDITION, there were no refried beans in sight in the meat burger. What is truth and what is lies?!?

A call to The Burgernator only resulted in an apology and a promise to ""make it up to us next time"". What next time, Burgernator? I will never trust you again. This isn't a Rihanna/Chris Brown situation where I will go back to you after you hurt me. I'm calling it quits for good. To add further insult to injury, my boyfriend actually ended up going all the way back to get a refund for the food that we were no longer willing to eat. When he went back, the cook actually had the nerve to harass him and blame us for not checking the burgers ourselves, even though THEY were the ones who mislabelled the boxes. Awesome.

*UPDATE* I had a chance to connect with the owner, Amer, who was sincerely apologetic and lovely. While I don't hold this experience against him or the restaurant as a whole, it's a shame that there seems to be a certain level of disorganization in the kitchen.

2 hours later we were ready to pay our tab and had to request the balance of our $50.

751,1,"Got turned on to this place from a old coworker, so I've been here once before. It's a decent Karaoke spot with some good food, deals on drinks, and pricing for rooms. Although there was one big problem when I went there last time and here's the story.

Decided to check it out again with a few friends randomly one night after a drink at the bar. I gave them a call and they quoted $15 for an hour for a group of four which was $5 less than another Karaoke Bar I called, HORAY! Thus, we decided to give it a try. So we take a Uber from to bar to embark on a KARAOKE ADVENTURE! 

So we arrived and it waited outiside the main bar area until we were helped. Nice black and white decor with the little crystal like chandeliers hanging over the tables. Quite classy I must say! Although, it's kind of late to still have a Christmas Tree up, it's almost February. TAKE IT DOWN and put some hearts or something, I don't know!

Anyways, we get a room after 10 minutes or so of waiting. The room included sleek black couches which we're very comfortable, a table to have drinks and food on, disco lights to set the mood, 2 tambourines, 2 microphones, and complimentary chips (which was probably there to dry your throats to encourage you to drink, smart... VERY SMART!). We were ready to party! But but 1st let me check in on TRUSTY OL' YELP!

As I checked in YELP on my smartphone I've noticed they have a deal for FREE SHVD ICE (One per room). Sounds like SHAVED ICE, a delicious treat! So I ask the young gentleman DO I GET THIS FOR CHECKING IN?!?!?! He then tells me to mention his name, give them a review, and HE'LL GET EVERYONE A ROUND OF FREE DRINKS! Sounds like a great deal if I were cheap and can be bribed easily to give a good Yelp review, but hey, I'm not easily swayed. I'm already buzzing and I don't want spend this time writing fake review when I can go home and write A REAL REVIEW after I've enjoyed and experienced this place. 

So we sing horribly throughout the night and we get the Soju deal BUY TWO GET ONE FREE! The third bottle will definitely help drown out off key, off pitch, off everything singing so good deal!  By the third bottle it has been almost two hours and I noticed that they haven't really checked up on us. It would be nice to have them check at least once nearing the end of every hour to make sure everything is ok and if we want to continue with another one. But hey, I guess he already has the review in the bag?

Overall the Karaoke Bar was your standard affair. Could use less bribes and better service which is the main reason why it scored lower on THE JULS SCALE. I noticed I didn't even get the Shaved Ice in the end for checking in, oh well!",1043,3
752,1,"I like Chinese buffets as well as the next guy. You know the drill... All you can eat of modestly-priced somewhat greasy Chinese food. But honestly I lost my appetite after one plate, so they certainly made a good profit on my dinner tonight.

To be fair, a big part of my bad experience was that they seated me next to a table of 10 teenage hooligans who (it seemed to me) were having a contest to see if they could do something outrageous enough to get themselves thrown out of the restaurant.  Unluckily for the rest of the diners, the hooligans won... Nobody from the wait staff or management lifted a finger to even suggest that their shouting, singing, throwing food, loud belching or shrill whistling was the least bit unacceptable. They also left the buffet itself in a very unappetizing state each time any of them visited to fill their plates.

To give them one star because of rowdy diners wouldn't be entirely fair; However, the food didn't deliver either. Most of the dishes were quite unappetizing. Greasy, shiny & overcooked seemed to be the norm. The crispy duck -- rather unique in a buffet setting -- was acceptable, though some of the garnishes showed signs of serious aging. The inclusion of more traditional Scottish fare on the buffet -- chips, mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts -- didn't score any authenticity points. Honestly the high point of my meal was the dish of soft-serve ice cream at its end, which (though they offered no toppings to speak of) was light and smooth.

I walked by the other branch of Jimmy Chung's (down by Waverly) and that one looked much nicer.  But I won't be giving this branch another try.",2253,3

I knew better but was walking in 115 degree heat and the kids needed to eat, so I drank the Kool-Aid.  $8.00 BudLight? $16.00 Chili Dog with canned Chili on top? YUP. SHEEP. Feed the sheep and steal their money. You think these morons from All Ports know what a a $1.00 Chili-Dog and an awesome American (ButtWeiser) costs? Nope. That's Vegas.

764,1,"Der Laden ist relativ zentral in der Innenstadt gelegen. Die Auswahl ist groß, ohne überwältigend zu sein. Von allem ist etwas im Angebot, ohne dass irgendein Bereich wirklich ausreichend vorhanden wäre. Man könnte es am ehesten mit der Feinkostabteilung eines größeren Kaufhauses vergleichen. Insgesamt ist es zu keinem Zeitpunkt eine ernsthafte Alternative zur Markthalle oder einem echten Fachgeschäft.


 Wirklich unangehehm wirken auf mich zwei Aspekte: die Preise sind völlig utopisch und nur in Ausnahmefällen in einer Relation zum tatsächlichen Wert der Ware. Damit in direktem Zusammenhang steht dem Anschein nach das überwiegende Publikum. In der - irrigen - Annahme, Geld und soziale Stellung würden gutes Benehmen in der Öffentlichkeit oder gar Rücksichtnahme gegenüber Dritten ersetzen und unnötig machen, verhalten sich diese Nouveaux Riches, vorzugsweise Damen und Herren in der reiferen Jugend, selbstgefällig, meist sogar autistisch.

It was smothered with  . . . oh heck, I don't know . . but it tasted awful.  The steak was ordered medium, received well done, but did have good taste.  Sadly, and 85 year old woman couldn't chew the well done lump of a steak.  The chips and dip were as nasty as before.  The oil is old and tastes rancid.

The girl seating people was very nice and apologetic, but even our waitress was unresponsive.  We also both ordered our salads with the dressing on the side and after an hour they couldn't even get that right.  My friend went ahead and ate hers as is, but I sent mine back.  The second salad came out very quickly which I was grateful for.  Since we were in a hurry at this point we asked for our checks immediately.  We had asked for separate checks, but when we got the check it was together.  The waitress took it back and separated them for us.

I decided on the flying hound burger and fries my wife went with the spicy blue burger and fries and a glass of wine. We waited for a while but no curds.. After a while our food showed up. Still no curds.... Kind of the reason we went. They asked if we still wanted them but what was the point. We were starving so time to eat. I dug into the fries and I will say they were delicious. I the bit into my burger. Ummm how can I say this so you get true feel for it. It was like trying the bite through rubber (that should do) Trying to bite through the bun was a chore. Once I did I can say the actual meat was good. I should have asked for no arugula on it or taken it off but that's on me. My wife had a similar problem with the bun. She was also a little turned off as far as the flavor. She likes spice and there was none in her mind. She can handle some pretty spicy foods so it may have been spicy to someone but not up to her standards. Prices weren't bad but I expected better quality.

926,1,"Walked in here excited to try a new pizza place supported by AMAZING reviews. What I saw left me tremendously disappointed. The bottom line: there is too much cross-contamination for people with food restrictions or allergies to eat here safely.

I'm a pescetarian (fish only) and my mom is a vegetarian. We can eat at most places with little trouble. This restaurant would have been impossible. 

The quick service build-your-own concept is great. Most places (e.g. Chipotle and Subway) do it well. That's precisely where Fired Pit failed. Everything was done by hand - only the sauce used a utensil. This meant that workers were putting their hands in meat (often covered in sauce) and then putting their hands directly into the veggies (without changing gloves) my mom and I are after. Yuck! We choose not to eat these foods, but the design of this restaurant would force us to come into contact with them. 

It's simple to fix this. Employees could change gloves between every customer, and they could use utensils for meat (as Chipotle does) or pre-portion it (as Subway does). Not only would this help standardize serving sizes (reducing overall food costs), it also prevents the very cross-contamination that prompted my mom and I to leave without ordering.

If you have a food allergy of ANY kind, steer clear! Way too much cross contamination. They order gluten-free crusts, but the design of their kitchen leads me to believe that you would likely still come into contact with gluten. 

I also watched an employee drop a towel on the ground, shake it off, and go back to using it to wrap around the handle of pizza peels he was shoving into the ovens. While it never came into direct contact with any food, I'm wary of any open-air kitchen that is so cavalier about dropping something on the ground and continuing to use it right in front of customers. 

Bottom line: the concept is great, but the execution falls short of what it should.",5117,5

Hi Angie, Jan S. sent you a message on Yelp:
Subject: Your Review
""Hi Angie,
I'm messaging you, because of the review you left on our yelp page. The restaurant business is a really tough one and we wish every other business/restaurant the best luck and success. I really doubt what you wrote is true since we massage our seasoning into the fresh cut chicken breast evenly, and than prepare some for a final check. Our tzatziki sauce is made fresh with the best ingredients, and mixed well with professional cooking equipment. There could be a very rare possibility that either our fresh chicken itself, or the house made tzatziki sauce wasn't mixed properly, but both at the same time, sorry that's just not true and you know it. I know for sure that you are trying to help your friends business. What you don't know is that you are about to hurt their business significantly. WE DO NOT WANT TO HURT ANYONES BUSINESS, that's the last thing we want. 
We are very disappointed by your review, because we take our food very serious. 
You have a few options.
We would like to offer you to come in, and have another (if you actually had one) grilled chicken pita on the house and tell us and yelp how you liked it. We really care about our customers, and please know that you are welcome any time smile emoticon !
( Just say you're Angie who wrote the yelp review and you'll receive a free chicken pita meal/Combo) 
If we see your review in the next few weeks unchanged, we will HEAVILY advertise in Cafe Mix's area until we get every single customer of them, and you know for sure that if they try our food once, they will never come back to cafe mix. We take this very seriously and we do not appreciate it. You successfully introduced us to this advertising option. Please take this seriously. Again we do not want to hurt anyones business especially Cafe Mix because they are our friends. By the way, If we are just around your corner from your work and cafe mix is even closer I do not believe that you know where we are located, and that you were actually here at Pita Island. The crossroads are Higley and Brown just for your information.
Best regards,
Mike - Pita Island Manager""",4335,5

Too bad the private room is in the basement by the restrooms in a very non-Church-like setting. More importantly, the food was definitely sub-par for this bride-to-be. First, the portions were rather small. My fiance's pasta dish only had about 5 forkfuls of noodles. I ordered the salmon, which came with ""mashed potatoes""...now if these were ""mashed potatoes,"" they would make your mother's lumpy attempts or boxed instants look like rockstars.

Was seated at our  table and waited a full 10 minutes for the waiter to introduce himself and order our drinks on a Friday at lunchtime when the restaurant was not that busy. I think he clearly forgot about us but would be more attentive with our meal. Offered  chowder (do not know the difference between Manhattan or New England) as an option for a soup and later came back to us and told us that he was out, that can happen but he should've known.

Since we had just arrived from Philly we asked if it would be possible to be seated a few minutes early - we were told no even though one side of the room was empty.  She glanced at the bar and as it was full she told us to go wander around -- not a great start.

Once they were ready for us they sat us at a terrible table - right at the bottom of the stairs and next to the wine station.  We moved to a slightly better table, but were told that the decent tables were reserved - I guess the fact that we had a reservation and had asked for a window table did not matter.

The service was polite but slow and a bit inept.  They filled my half-full margaretta glass with water.  When I mentioned it they grabbed the glass - I figured to replace it, but not so - my drink was gone.

The menu was a bit of a mess -way too complicated.  They also specialize in Mediterranean fish,, but they sell them by the gram (how many Americans have a feel for just what a gram is?) but some fish were only available for two or more people.  This was way too much trouble to figure out.

Dinner was just average - since the only seafood that I wanted was for 3 and no one else was interested I had chicken- not bad, but a disappointment as I was hoping for exotic seafood.  The others in my party felt the same way though my father only ate about 4 bites of his risotto and the waitstaff never even asked if he liked it - when you see an almost untouched plate the waiter needs to at least ask.

You have all the potential to be my best friend. We are not best friends though because your never there when I need you, you are inconsistent in your advice and you take more then you give. I just, as a friend, do not feel like you really care. 

The first few times I visited this place was great! Lots of accoutrements. The New Yorker was delicious! Cream cheese, tomato, onion, lox, capers all piled high on a fresh egg bagel! Yes please! Where do I sign!!! 

Now, I'm not going to state credentials on being a master of bagels or an aficionado. 

I will say that this place feels overpriced for what you are getting. I am speaking of quality of ingredients and care of composition not portion sizes. 

Sometimes the bagels are stale, sometimes they are cut wrong and sometimes they are toasted wrong. Sometimes the capers are fresh, some times the lox is fresh. All this being said the opposite of all of those things are also ""sometimes"" true. 

Sometimes I get that little thin slice, which is supposed to be the top half but it's not... I dislike that thing. The employees should pay more attention. If it comes out like that how about cutting another? 

They stopped making egg bagels. Really that was the best part, the reason for going. 

In closing, everything bagel doesn't have everything nor do they everything well all of the time. However, they do tell you everything you want to hear and then break your heart. 

We had a good run. See you around kid.

P.s. Selling day old bagels is a great idea, but incase you didn't know day old bagels don't have mold on them. Good luck!

As soon as we sat down, we noticed a few similarities to Holstein's, like the ""Bamboozled Shakes"" which are milk shakes with alcohol mixed it.

My husband and I ordered the spinach-artichoke dip as an appetizer. IT tasted great, but the portion was too big. I ended up getting the Captain Hook, which was a burger with crispy beer battered atlantic cod instead of beef.  It was great, except for the gigantic bun that it was served in.  My husband ordered the Perfect Burger, but said it was not-so perfect. He ordered it Medium and it was overcooked.  The Onion Marmalade and Roasted Tomatoes were unrecognizable and were overpowering.  After he removed the onions and the tomoatoes, the burger was decent enough to finish.  Again, the bun was way too big.  The only thing that saved that burger was the smoked bacon, LBS BBQ sauce, and herb mayo.

The chicken tasted like a combination between pork rinds and some kind of other meat. The chicken was overcooked and had way too much teriyaki sauce on it. The mixed vegetables was all mostly cabbage. If you want some good teriyaki chicken I suggest Ross J's Hawaiian or hell even Teriyaki Madness.,6377,5

Back then, I heard numerous times about how great this place was, about strategies for holding out until the best meats arrived, and about the awesomeness of the salad bar. At the time I had recently returned to school to pursue my MA degree, so money was tight and I was never able to afford to try it. But I was intrigued. 

Fast forward to 2009. When I moved back to Ahwatukee from a long exile in Surprise, trying Fogo e Brasa (or Brazilian Bull as they now call themselves) was high on my list. My wife and I made reservations and showed up, expecting something amazing.

I don't know. The food was good enough: all-you-can-eat meats that they bring on skewers to your table. I think other reviewers have described the process so I'll skip that. Some of the meats were fantastic, others not so much. Nothing was terrible, but only one or two things were excellent. We were expecting at least one very high end meat, perhaps filet mignon, and it never came, so we were disappointed by that. The salad bar was everything people say it is, but for the price I would expect that. Drinks were expensive. Service was decent, but not outstanding.

I had a spicy burger which was cooked medium.  The bacon wrapped around the pepper inside was a little disappointing.  It was not crispy and was in fact, pretty undercooked and soggy.  The idea of the burger was pretty good, it just didn't come out the way I had hoped.  I finished really fast and got out of there because of the heat.

I used my Crackberry to give me a list of a few crepe places on the Strip and up jumps Crazy Crepes.

Me being the person who hates the consumeristic shit that Vegas throws upon us, I skipped all of the high end clothiers and other assorted bullshit in the Fashion Square Mall and decided to quench my crepe thirst here.  

They ingeniously placed pictures and pertinent signage of nearly every crepe on the menu.  That gives the visual person like me a chance to take a look at what the fuck I am eating before ordering.  For others it isn't necessary, but for me this is compulsory.  After I ordered, I realized that they had a full menu of all kinds of crepes including ice cream.

I decided to order the Blueberries and Cream crepe.  Vanilla ice cream and whipped cream accompanied this piece of shit.  

Vegas is known for finding inventive ways to siphon money out of the tourist's pocket when they arrive and this is one more way to do it.....if one doesn't shop, gamble, or take advantage of the numerous ways to obtain sex in the 702, then dine at places such as these.

Located in the hotel Paris, the atmosphere and decor around were pleasant. With a impersonating blue sky overhead, the area gives you a slight feel of Vegas' version of the great city. However, that is where the pluses seem to stop.

Upon gazing over the menu, delicious descriptions of simple dishes give way to belief of something worth dinning on. This was not the case. The bread they brought out to us was bland and almost disgusting. It looked appealing, hence why I decided to try it. But to my surprise, it was way worse than I anticipated.

I decided to order the chicken parmagana as my main dish. The description was great, and the smells of fresh food filled the air to accompany my appetite. When the dish arrived at the table, I was greeted by a, what I assume, previously frozen chicken cutlet topped with what tasted like canned tomato sauce. The dish had ""processed"" or frozen written all over it. However, to pay respects to the staff and chef, I finished my meal without verbal complaint.

92,2,"The good - the Carolina pulled pork is great in both taste and proportion size. Beans are top notch as well. Eating area is always clean and immaculate.
The bad - the bbq chicken consists of a leg & a SPLIT thigh. Hardly enough for even a child.
The ugly - the wait staff is friendly although absent minded (forgot to bring drinks and take our order). At other times they are easily overwhelmed with only 3-4 tables. The kitchen is painfully slow. When the waitress says she's sorry for the delay in the kitchen because a table of 6 came in & they're overwhelmed. Counting us, that makes 9 customers total. All the deserts are apparetnly made with 50% whipped cream. I don't like my bananna pudding thinned out with anything OK? The mustard based bbq sauce needs some work (why is it green), the Carolina sauce is really quite good, Beef brisket is 1 inch thick slices, ROUND of all shapes, & about 5 inches in daimeter. It's also consistantly dry - which I can't attribute to its non-rectangular shape. And lastly, the men's restroom door still has a busted door lock after all these months.
I would recommed the owner make some changes:
1) add Great Lakes Dortmunder beer, only you and Olive Garden don't carry this local favorite.
2) fix that brisket, think 2"" x 6"" rectangular moist beef with plenty of ""bark"" on the perimeter.
3) take the whipped cream out of all the desserts, they taste great w/o this adulteration.
4) FOOTBALL SEASON - yeah, all my southern bbq joints offer a Sunday special: 1lb of pulled pork (inside or outside cut), 4 big soft sandwich buns, Qt of beans, Qt of slaw. I call ahead and pick up before the game.
On a side note, Old Carolina BBQ is gradually creeping northward. Once they expand into Portage County I probably won't be back. Although competition is usually good for the customer, only time will tell.
UPDATE 12/2014:  I guess the owner didn't heed any of the reviews and now they're closed - I saw that comin' a good 12 months in advance.  They should have called Robert Irvine from Restaurant Impossible.  This place was worth saving.",5571,4

111,2,"Apparently this is the new kick it spot for college kids.  If you're wondering how a bar can be so appealing, like I did, think of it as Commonwealth-like with cheap drinks in a more centrally located area. 

Decided to check it out on a Friday night because my friend won open bar for herself & half off drinks for her friends. The drinks... Blechhh. The bartenders must have heavy hands, the drinks were way too strong to consume. I asked for a Vodka Lemonade and had to toss it in the trash midway. 

There's plenty of space- a patio in the back, loads of booths and tables, dance floor, an area for BP, and 3 bars scattered around. Despite all the space, this place was still packed! It's hard to get around.  And ladies, don't think you can rush to the bathroom when you had too much to drank. There's always a line of ~5 girls, so plan your bathroom trips accordingly. 

One thing I did love was the music selection! They played everything, old and new. Weird that they place that Blue da ba di da ba die song, but it was pretty cool when they played The Outfield's ""Your Love"" and everyone busted out singing, ""and I don't wanna lose your love toniiiiight."" Who knew college kids could jam to the old school stuff too.",4320,5

However the nachos left alot to be desired.  There was both cheese sauce and cheese on them.  Super weird.  The steak was of much poorer quality than when I used to frequent House of Brews.  I am hoping with was a 1 off bad experience.  I plan on going back but next time ordering something different.",930,4
115,2,"On a weeknight, you don't have to worry about paying for street parking, which is a plus. I actually parked on the street right in front of the restaurant, since the valet parking signs were only valid for Friday through Sunday. I must not have been violating any parking signs since the police parked across the street didn't ticket or tow! =)

I started with the mixed mesclun ($7), since pasta entrees do not come with a salad, and there is no side salad portion. This is big enough for two people. I thought some of the greens were a wilted and old but I was hungry. I did like how the salad was a bit salted. Personally, I don't salt salad, but it was a nicely added flavor since these greens can be slightly bitter. 

For an entree, I ordered the calamari pasta ($18). It's my mistake for not realizing the pasta contained escarole instead of just calamari and marinara sauce. I personally am not a fan of escarole since it has a bitter taste, but I ate as much as possible. I picked out the greens, and the pasta tasted great. The calamari was hands down, probably one of the best cooked calamari I've had since going to Greece. It was lightly breaded (not too much, not too little), and it was the perfect texture. Calamari can easily be rubbery, but this was the melt-in-your-mouth kind.

I would've given three stars for the food and ease of parking, but my stomach became upset as SOON as I returned to my hotel and the condition was on and off the rest of the night. I very rarely get stomach upsets (given how much I travel), but I did this time. So, two stars (meh, I've experienced better) it is!",6794,4

In the past when I've gone to Johnny Rockets, I wasn't in love with the burgers, but I still thought they were very good. When we got our food today, it looked and tasted like they really downgraded their quality. Look how boring and lifeless my Route 66 burger looked: http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/ewjc4OdQ5_ENVV5dUtoN_g/l.jpg. The buns looked like they were kind of smashed and there was a ridiculous amount of cheese inside (http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/6EO2CMyCBaEiSAYIMjGHjg/l.jpg). The only thing I really liked about my burger were the fresh mushrooms inside. Majority of the fries that came with our meals were undercooked or soggy.

However the california roll it was wrapped around was basically a big ball of rice with a skinny little slice of what should be crab and cucumber, but all you get is the taste of starchy, kind of hard, rice. (note the pic) And the greenbeans were swimming in oil, although had good flavor, not spicy like they should be. The roll was $9 and the green beans $4. I wont go back for the sushi for sure...

- I love the restaurant itself. The setting is beautiful.
- The chicken is good.
- The fries are good, albeit the greasy good kind.
- 13$ for a combo would be reasonable for a good lunch

Now the bad:

- I went the 2nd day after opening, the process was understandably disorganized. That's not an issue. The issue is that the process is weird. You walk in and: 1) you order at one end of the counter, 2) go pay at the other end of the counter and 3) return to the 1st place to get your food. That's so counter-productive. What's wrong with 1) order and pay, 2) get your food and be on your way!

- The sandwich is 80% bread and 20% meat. Oh no! That was such a disappointment. Put some of that delicious chicken inside your sandwich!! 

- The combo doesn't include a drink! WTF? The combo is sandwich + fries + salad. You don't make friends with salad. Salad sucks. Give me a exciting drink to go with my  delicious sandwich!

As of late, I can't believe this place is still in business, and the owners never took my advice of taking out the bed of cabbage from the Loco Moco!   Who ever heard of putting the egg and hamburger on a bed of cabbage, then sitting the rice to the side of the plate!    This display is exactly like making a pizza, and putting the cheese on the side.   Good grief, this is not too hard to correct.

I have to admit, their Kalbi isn't too bad at all, and their service is very good;  but the curry needs a lot of work, and Yummy have to  stop using those cheap frozen peas and carrots for their wok infused Chinese style curry.

We took up most of the center of the small place where tables were pushed together to accommodate us. Between us we probably ordered everything our third cousin had on the menu. Sadly when we left it was unanimously agreed when one aunt stated odd that the only Hungarian who cannot cook ends up a chef. 

I live in that neighborhood and at times return to the Diner when a friend calls and wants to meet me there. My third cousin left long ago but every replacement shares his deficiencies in the kitchen. I have had the hamburgers, the omelets and a few specials of the day. Recently I met my friend Lydia here for breakfast as it was a Monday and most places were closed. Nothing was good. The prices were high for boring food.

The later of the two is why I give it two stars, just not worth it. I have gone back a couple times to try it again, just because the sandwiches and salads are quite good.

However, at first greeting, the hostess was the RUDEST and most ARROGANT girl I've ever encountered. Now, I travel a lot for work and eat at many restaurants (all flavors, sizes, etc) and I have never been greeted the way we were (which was like trash). We walked up and she stared at us with a blank expression on her face, like we were bothering her while she was standing around not doing a thing, she still never greeted us. Finally after what felt like way too long, my boyfriend looks at her and says ""two please"". She asks if we have reservations, we say no, she proceeds to become even more annoyed, rolls her eyes and then grabs two menus (doing whatever she can to not make eye contact) and has someone lead us to our table. We were in SHOCK, this is supposed to be a 'classy' place. I'm a business professional in sales and so is my boyfriend. I couldnt believe that the first person to greet you at a restaurant happens to be the most unpleasant person. I'd rethink hiring someone with some better customer service skills and lack of attitude.

The décor had some other themes to it and was somewhat of an eclectic selection from the candle holders to the wall art.  Now, the sports bar?  I've never seen a Japanese restaurant with a big screen TV behind the sushi chefs with the popular football game of the night on.

So I was here to take The Wife on a long-overdue date since our son has been an incredible beast lately.  Honestly, raising the next generation of Yelpers is tough, especially when they share your ""pizzazz.""  So we came for a quite dinner for The Wife's favorite, Japanese food.

The softshell crab roll she got was unremarkable.  There's only so much spicy tuna, ponzu sauce, and sriracha that people can experiment with to come up with the next ""creative"" sushi.  I'm a traditionalist - give me normal nigiri or sashimi and be done with it.  I had the chirashi and was disappointed - the chirashi at Tachibana in McLean had more fish and better variety for a ""special"" box than they had at Sen.  I felt like I had wasted my money.

That is NOT equivalent exchange. So when you come here prepare to ""pull up please"" but first he prepared for someone to try to renegotiate your order to make their job a bit more easier.",2146,5

The guy at the window, Adrian, was the kind of employee I would want to have working for me. He was friendly, informative and helpful answering all my questions. I selected the 4 piece chicken tender meal with ranch sauce, fries and a drink. 

The food (tenders and fries) were very hot which I liked. But the look, texture and taste was less than impressive. I called my girlfriend, who was dying to know how it was. I know she was hoping I could report wonderful news. I snapped a pic of the piping hot chicken tender that was happily burning my fingers. She responded with, ""It looks burnt and dry.""  

I'm a die hard ranch sauce fan but their ranch sauce would ward off an entire army of vampires.  The smell of garlic is permeating my jeep and I fear the worst for my pores.

While it tastes good, it really isn't a very good value.  If you can wait a while and pay more than most other places, this place is for you.

First off, the quality of Asian cuisine in NE Ohio is top-notch. The surrounding areas are littered with economic choices that leave the belly full with quality food without torching one's wallet. Noodlecat definitely doesn't fit that mold. The food was tasty, but I can't see myself ever spending $12 for a bowl a soup again anytime soon.  With so many other choices within a ten minute drive, Noodlecat falls short of providing any value.  The portions are small and the taste wasn't good enough to offset it.  I had the Takahachi Ramen and the non-meat steam bun.  The name escapes me.  I was absolutely starving after I finished.  The bartender was cool and they do have Black Label for $2, and $1 during Happy hour.  But, inexpensive crappy beer doesn't do much when I was there to eat.  Location is undesirable as well as parking is always a nightmare down there.  Maybe I was expecting more but, I would go back only if I wanted to eat downtown and everything else was booked.

Needless to say I was rushed at the end to eat and return to my meeting, gratefully the chairman was with me for lunch.

The menu offers a nice Mexican and American dishes, but I would suggest the Mexican side, come on, that is obviously their thing, specials of Tamales and such, you can go to McDonald's and get a hamburger (without the wait of course).

I ordered the Burrito Enchilada style, which was good and authentic.  Once the food arrived, it was hot and had the typical Sonoran taste that you get in Phoenix.  The food was good and kept this review above 1 star which is where the service was putting it.

My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell-tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild.

I struggle a little bit with the ""gastropub"" classification on this one, unless you call any bar & grille establishment a gastropub.  I've never had food here that I was particularly fond of, nor would I consider it one of their selling points.  It's merely ok.

Overall the burger didn't look amazing as I unwrapped the foil but it tasted fresh and the single serving of fries is enough to feed 2 people

Bottom line i would of gave it one star if it wasn't for all the free toppings you can add, but I'd rather go to InNOut and get a double double meal and spend less money for something just as fresh ! minus the mushrooms and jalapeños or just go to smashburger for about the same price !",122,4

Entering the buffet area, I was first drawn to the pasta table - big mistake! 

Filled up in that before realizing there was still cod fish, sliders, and crab cakes... my favorite out of everything.  Any pasta I tried was all the same and nothing special, the lasagna was alright but mushy.  

The sweets left something to be desired.   Maybe the cream puffs were the best of all I had tried - and I am a lover of all sweets.  It was also difficult to tell what anything was because it wasn't indicated.. So it was kind of a surprise to try everything including the ice cream.

Also, the shakes are like 50% foam. What's up with that?

Two stars - because The Coffee.  Somehow every type of coffee I've had there - I'm partial to espressos, cortados, and americanos - has only ever been adequate, and some of them were a lukewarm mess - not to mention the most expensive I've experienced on this strip of St Clair West.  All the friendliness in the world can't make up for the incompetence of the person pulling your coffee.  The coffee beans there are top-notch so I assume the staff is where it's gone wrong.

I got the chicken dish (which at the time was different than the one they have on their menu now) and some other members of my family got the filet mignon and we all shared the Au Gratin potatoes and mashed potatoes. Our first experience was fabulous. The steaks were done perfectly and my chicken was moist, delicious, and flavorful. 

Unfortunately the experience has declined with each subsequent visit...

The very last time we went (early February of this year) was terrible. I had the chicken dish as well as the steaks that my family had and they were all horribly, horribly dry and bland. The chicken was the driest I've ever had in my LIFE- certainly not worth almost $30 I paid for it. And the steaks were overcooked as well! It was the biggest waste of money- I barely ate 1/3 of my meal, if even that. No one could finish their steaks either.

I'm giving The Capital Grille 2 stars because the first time we went was wonderful and all of the food was delicious. In addition, the service has always been pretty good and the atmosphere is nice. However, the experience's we've had since then have not been fitting for a restaurant of this caliber (and not to mention price). The Au Gratin potatoes have been consistently tasty, but how can you really mess up cheesy potatoes? We've been adamant on giving The Capital Grille a few more chances after the great first impression, but unfortunately we've learned that it is just too expensive of a risk after so many disappointments.",7050,4

In fact the pricing was 15% better prior to the government imposition of mandatory invoicing. That is, the pricing was tax in whereas now it's plus tax. Great business model when it's cash only eh!!!!I recommend you bring your favorite wine or one or two steps above so you can have something nice to say at the end.

Still doesn't make it better knowing I paid for a rotten drink. 2nd time. Order was completely wrong, wrong chicken parts, wrong sides, wrong tortillas and NO avocado sauce even asking three times. Money thrown away yet again, always a disappointment when you're craving a certain meal. Yesterday, ordered the new Avocado salad plus a 2pc dinner. The 2pc meal was correct...YAY! Now the photo of the salad on the board shows like 10 slices or more of avocado. MINE, ONE brown slice!?!?!. Oh come on! Now you owe me three free dinners as far as I'm concerned. Money is tight, time is even more precious. I choose this place because it's one of the healthier fast foods. But now, the service is terrible, they normally have amazing drive thru staff, so polite & accommodating, especially for fast food. On a good note, the salad was a good salad- black beans, cabbage...fresh and nice for a 100 degree day. The dressing is amazing. But one slice of brown avocado doesn't make me very happy. I'm hoping they get their act back together there. I don't mind paying their higher prices for their menu, but they need to get on top of their soda machines, double check the orders so they are correct & get some customer service back to this crew.

I can't complain because the prices were indicative of what I was expecting but I don't see another visit in the near future.",4346,5
537,2,"Their truffle fries were yum for appetizer. We were a group of six. Two of us tried their all American prime burger and loved it. One are a vegetarian burger that she thought was okay. Their steak grilled cheese was very nice and one of us had the dinner special. It was a miso salmon with white rice and asparagus. I tried a fish taco and didn't care for it. The fish was dry and the taco itself was not great. All in all, we had a mix experience. If I go again, I will definitely go for their truffle fries and stay away from their fish taco and veg burgers. Cheers",260,4

I met a friend here for lunch on a Monday. The restaurant sign says it's open seven days a week, but it was closed.",8044,5
541,2,I ordered the sage chicken Benedict. The portion was crazy large. The fried chicken was good. The sauce was a bit spicy and the fried cheese layer was no longer melted when it came out. I don't think I will need to return to one.,5310,4

547,2,"Der Biergarten um den Brunnen am Rotebühlplatz ist ja eigentlich schon einen Besuch wert und unter dem riesigen Baum verbreitet sich auch schnell die Vision eines echt Münchner Brauhausrestaurants, wenn nicht die unverschämten Kellner und -innen im Stil der Massenabfertigung einem sowohl Essen als auch Getränke hinschmeissen würden.


 Das Essen war früher mal sehr gut nach meinem Gaumen, hat aber in den letzten Jahren erheblich nachgelassen und ist heute allenfalls noch mittelmäßig. Dafür sind die Portionen immer noch riesig und verhältnismäßig preisgünstig. Doch vermisst man die knusprige Kruste des Schweinsbratens mit Kartoffelknödel und findet statt dessen eine lapprige Schwarte auf seinem Teller. Reklamation - unmöglich! Originaler Kommentar: Das gehört so!


 Auch die Rahmpilze mit Semmelknödel eher ein Sahnemus ohne jegliche Rafinesse. Sicherlich ist der namensgebende Bierlieferant recht lecker, aber selbst bei moderaten Preisen sollte man schon der eigenen Leber zuliebe darauf verzichten sich das Ambiente schön zu trinken.


 Das Personal unterlässt es auch nicht am Nebentisch über andere Besucher mit den Gästen zu witzeln was eine absolute Frechheit ist und sich für einen Serviceangestellten nicht gehört, aber das stört hier nur diejenigen hinter deren Rücken getuschelt wird. Wobei Tuscheln nicht ganz die richtige Bezeichnung für die angeschlagene Lautstärke ist. Vielleicht versucht man so auch die kostbaren Plätze wieder frei zu bekommen, wenn man feststellt, das der Gast nur noch gemütlich an seinem Getränk nippen möchte und nicht mehr umsatzförderlich eine Bestellung nach der anderen dem Ober übermittelt. Wie man oft beobachten kann funktionierts. Dabei scheint die Rechnung immer aufzugehen, da keine Tisch sehr lange unbesetzt bleibt und auch sonst jeder freie Platz selbst durch zusätzliche Bestuhlung für den Abverkauf erschlossen wird.


 Die Atmosphäre ist teilweise so hecktisch, dass man schon von sich aus es vorzieht schnell die Rechnung zu fordern, die genauestens beäugt werden sollte, da schon mal das eine oder andere sich untergemogelt hat, was man weder bestellt geschweige denn bekommen oder zu sich genommen hat.",3532,5

549,2,"I gave this place 2 stars here's why service WAS HORRIBLE. It was our first time here and I can say I'm not impressed. Our waiter was not personable at all. He didn't great us with a smile or even tell us his name. I felt like he was miserable and did not want to be here. We also felt very rushed when ordering. We asked about the chile because there is a ""caution""on the menu pertaining to how hot it is. All he said was ""what ever you prefer"" didn't even mention the taste or how spicy they were.... Once we order we never saw him again. He walked by us Numerous times never asked us how anything was or even if we needed anything (which we did) We had to ask two other servers for drinks and our check. The place was nice very different decor. Just a bunch of random pictures all over and stuff. We sat in the bar area so I can't speak for the dinning area. The food was good but I wasn't blown away by it. The portions are huge here. Which is something I don't really like personally. I feel like it's just a waste of food (and also part of the reason why Americans are so obese. Definitely no reason for any place to give huge portion sizes... Sorry about my personal note hehe) it's also very dark in this place when I walked out side I was blinded by the sun like. (Bugs life: ""don't look into the light!!!""). The orange juice was my favorite part about this place. It was great fresh squeezed! Anyways we won't be going back to this place.",4583,4
551,2,"Really? This is what yinzers consider good BBQ? Im from Texas so i sure wasnt tricked. The pork was half way decent at best and the chicken didn't even taste like BBQ chicken (had an off flavor). The ribs looked like every other rack in the city, hard and dry.

The only thing I enjoyed, probably because I was uber hungry at the time, was the Cheese Beer Sausage Soup.",2938,4

Our server was excellent, very attentive, not very impressed with lack of subs on the specialty pies.  We did a substitution but charged us additional for our choice of topping which I thought was weird.  Also far too many red onions on their veggie pie.

This we time we had family from out of town and mom wanted to come here to try their dim sum with the family... So I took the initiative to get a table for the family.. Place was completely packed at 9:30am, waited till about 10:45 for a table..

At the end of this experience, I can't really say that there was any dish worth 4 stars.. The food really was just regular 3 stars.. And it's not like it's super cheap. But the wait time is horrible.

576,2,"... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service, thats just ludicrous. (Not Ludacris, close but not the same.)

I have just recently moved to Beechview and the best part of moving to a new part of this wonderful city is giving new businesses a try! I have sampled so many tasty and amazing new food items and coffee drinks etc etc. I am always in search of a non-smoking bar where I can hang out, eat, drink, and get to know the locals. I prefer small bars with ""yinzers"" as they tend to be a true gauge of a neighborhood for me. 

We have many friends in this area, which means that we got some great tips before we even moved in about different types of food, stores, laundromats, and bars. One of these tips, repeated from friend to friend, was The Huddle. As the name implies it is a bar where you can be certain you can watch a sports game of whatever sport-ball type you're interested in. It is indeed non-smoking, a handful of tables suitable for 4 people and a ""U"" shaped bar right in the center as soon as you come in. It is a cash only establishment with an ATM on site for quick transactions. The have free popcorn from a popcorn machine which makes the place smell amazing. It's been around quite a while which means that there is a great group of locals who frequent the establishment. 

This is truly everything I need in a local bar. We had been in for the very first time for drinks shortly after moving in and happened to be in there on one of their two weekly wing nights. This are not the wee tiny wings, more a weird in between of some of the ""full"" size wings I've had other places that clearly came from giant monster mutant chickens (I mean maybe they were goose wings, who even knows... they were huge) and the teeny tiny wing night wings you find most other places. They have two options; buffalo (sloppy) and ""tanned"" which are buffalo then cooked again so they are drier and crisp and un-freaking-believeable. The prices are mega cheap and it's so filling and delicious we've been back more than once for them. I like this place so much we have even taken the handsome-boyfriend's mother there when she was in town for the weekend. (P.S. She loved it too!) 

My dear sweet lovely readers, here is where I have to talk about something less than all of the amazing parts I've already mentioned. Tonight, both ravenous from too little food and too much work-day, we trekked up the monster that is Coast Avenue for beers and food and a chill environment (that would undoubtably involve pre-season football). We walk in the door and aside from an employee (other than the bartender) and a few people in the back at tables, we are the only patrons aside from one regular. We belly up to the bar on the far side and say our hellos. This is where I get a serious case of the sad. The bartender working seemed annoyed by our presence. Ok, I get it... I work sort of indirectly with the public I have days where I can't handle people. It happens! As customers come in and sit down, she greets them with a warmth that was clearly lacking. Ok. That's sort of disappointing but still fine. When we got to the point that we asked for a menu three times while she retrieved menus and took orders for the people next to us an hour after we came in... thats where I start to have an issue with the service. Eventually we decided to leave because I was tipping over the line to ""hangry"" and was afraid I'd lose my temper after the 3rd time we had asked for menus and didn't get them while she continued to warmly greet other patrons and provide them menus and take their orders while refilling our beers seemed to be an annoyance to her to the point of not even asking if we wanted another or the same beer and just taking the glass and starting to fill it (wherein I had to stop her because I hadn't asked her for another one and actually just wanted the tab cashed out).

Yes, of course I'll give it another try, I want this to be my local hang out bar. My service in sitting at the table or being served by the woman I presume is the owner has been great. The food is amazing. The prices are great. Don't let me down, The Huddle.",1070,5
583,2,"the food was good, the service could have been better. we enjoyed the music some things you havent heard on the radio in years, where being played so it was nice. what i didnt like, every few min people would scream- and i mean SCREAM the waiters were egging on a crowd in the back to get loud, and after a long day of walking around the strip and just wanting a good meal- this kind of ruined it.",90,4
587,2,"After searching high and low, I can say that the Smallman Street Deli is probably the second best delicatessen in Pittsburgh.  That's not a huge compliment, however, as the deli scene is almost completely devoid of passable options (the only one I even like is Szmidt's, and they have a much smaller menu).

This Squirrel Hill eatery is but a shadow of the pastrami purveyors of New York City.  Were it to move across the state, Smallman Street would be but a footnote, unable to crack anyone's Top 10 list in Philadelphia.  But sometimes a facsimile is good enough, or even the best one can get.  While there may be better beef brisket and superior salami on distant horizons, one can still enjoy the capable corned beef and likable lox in this little corner of Western PA.",7478,4
591,2,"Super over priced and the food isn't that good.  The only reason why we've ever gone here is because it's one of the only places inside the Hard Rock Hotel to eat late.

595,2,"Went to this particular location 6 times with the family. Every single time we went they were out of multiple items. The store was not even that busy, and these times we went were usually on Friday, Saturday or Sunday around dinner time 6-7pm. Everything we tried to order would be a 25-30 minute wait. Ended up just ordering whatever they did have on hand. We watched many potential customers get turned down when they tried ordering things because they were out of those items. We finally stopped going to this location due to so many attempts and all times they were not prepared to sell chicken. The Gilbert Rd & Baseline location seems to be much more prepared for dinner than this E. Main St. location.",3075,4

608,2,"Service was excellent.  The menu offerings were spotty.

A group 16 of us attended the Saints-Steelers game in November.  We attend most of the away games and have an opportunity to eat at some very good restaurants.  

Lidia's was a place I was looking forward to because I am aware of her by reputation.   We had several appetizers including the bruschetta, which was really only to my liking.  The balsamic was excellent - syrupy and sweet - and clearly a nicely aged one.  But it was incongruous with the rest of the dish, and so not many enjoyed it.  

The bread served at the table was really very good and we devoured baskets of it. 

Comments from some of the other diners:

- Baked shrimp appetizer was pretty good, the calamari was very good.  
- Rucola  salad was (in my opinion) excellent
- Beet salad was interesting and overall very good
- Butternut squash soup was enjoyed by several of us
- Scampi alla Felidia was ordered by several guests with mixed opinions
- Lasagna bolognese?  so so at best

Gnocchi and duck ragu was what I ordered.  I was very disappointed. The duck was shredded and cooked into a sort of red congealed, thick mass with little texture.  The gnocchi were so underdone as to be a sort of glutinous paste sitting under the duck.  The texture was completely unappealing but I do have to say that the flavor of the duck ragu (ragout?) was pretty good. 

Still, the gnocchi - one of my favorite things and something I make myself probably once a month - were a disappointment.  I didn't send it back because it didn't seem appropriate in the setting of a very large group to monopolize the wait staff.  

I'd still give it a try again when I'm there in June, but it seems that some of their efforts are focused more on being creative, which is good, but falling somewhat short.

By the way, if you like a more traditional Italian and happen to be in St. Louis, Charlie Gitto's on the Hill is a great place. Similar in ambiance and quality to Lidia's, the service there can't be beat and the food is quite good as well.",6688,4
609,2,"I don't see what is so good about this place.  The Penne and chicken parmigano is good but the portions are very small for what you pay.   While the chicken is an alright amount, the amount of pasta is really minuscule.

It is very oily, when you reheat it the next day it's drenched in oil.

Might as well go to East Side Marios it's about the same and you get bread and unlimited salad.",6794,4
611,2,"Sorry to say this place has been better in the past.  It is in need of a really deep cleaning, there is a funky odor of natural gas when you walk in the door.

If you do eat in and order wings, make sure you tell them if you want them to come out BEFORE your pizza, otherwise everything comes out at the same time.",6802,5

Wow, prices are high here. We came during lunch time but since it was Sunday, full dinner prices apply at like 1pm. Both my sister and I were fooled by the ""Hibachi Noodles"" which was just lo mein. My ""steak"" was just stir fried pork-looking beef. Also, lo mein is usually around $9, maybe $10 for beef, but it was a full $13 here. Hubby always orders the pricey sashimi at every Japanese place but even he was surprised at the tiny portion for $28. There were 8 pieces of fish on a skinny appetizer sized plate and a pile of clear noodles that you don't eat. That was a huge rip-off. We know what the sashimi dinner looks like at every Japanese restaurant and this is definitely the smallest portion yet for the same price. 

It really sucks that all Asian restaurants have their bento box and lunch specials only during week days. Don't they know those are my unhappy-eat-at-my-desk-and-read-emails days? They would make so much more money if bento boxes could be had EVERY day. 
Also, no parking lot so get ready to vie for a place on the crowded street. 

Skip this pricey joint and get the same Chinese/Japanese fare anywhere else.",4040,4
633,2,"This location has too many tables and not enough buffet. I counted 5 counters including the drink station. Freakin' Hibachi Grill has way more selection. 

Other Country Buffets are great. This one needs therapy. No chicken enchiladas here. Don't you know, Country Buffet, that's what I went there for? They had a tub of chicken tortilla soup but absolutely no soup bowls. Tortilla soup on a plate leaks into the other foods. Not good. 

Oh, and they have French fries but the ketchup is nowhere to be found. And that's what I noticed about all the condiments. They aren't next to the right food. 

Hubby said the pizza wasn't good. My chocolate cake was very stale. I think the chef was a Le Cordon Bleu dropout.",75,4
636,2,"We don't have this fast food restaurant in Canada so I had to come back here after a stop in Montana three years ago. I remembered the burger to be delicious. I know its fast food but that doesn't mean it can't taste good. 
I had the original burger and the onion rings. I can say that while I ate every last ring, they were good but certainly not great. I had the burger the way it came and maybe I added bacon last time. It was good, I suppose even really good considering we are at a fast food joint. Its not going to unseat the Big Mac or even the Quarter Pounder in my mind but it was good. I think maybe i could eat here once a month, tops. 
My wife had the Guacamole and Bacon burger. She really loved it. I don't know, not my thing but she insisted I try it. After saying no thank you at least six times I finally graciously accepted a bite. Like I said, not my thing.

I have said it. T I N Y. Oh such small food, like we don't live in the land of plenty.

Even the baked mussels had the smell and it definitely told me that the mussels were frozen (and don't know how long it's been in the freezer).

The breads that got us started were really good, as was the butter and oils that accompanied them.

Our first course was calamari with curry aoli and a chopped vegetable salad. Neither were particularly enjoyable. The veggies and calamari were both overcooked causing one to be chewy and the other mushy. Both were a miss.

We both chose the halibut with cous cous, spinach, toasted orzo, lemon gremolata and sweet tomatoes for the main course. It was fine, the quality of the fish was lacking, but otherwise it was nicely prepared. A disappointment, because the halibut was the star on our last visit.

We finished the meal with banana cream pie and lemon blueberry cheesecake. I'm happy to report desserts are still fantastic at Vintner Grill. We enjoyed every bite.

661,2,This place gets 2 stars because I liked the macaroni and cheese and because the others in my group sort of liked their meals. I went with about a dozen people and got the brisket sandwich and macaroni and cheese. Let me start by saying that I am Jewish - I know brisket. I know how to serve it on a plate with potatoes and I know how to serve it in a sandwich. Imagine my surprise when I bit into the brisket only to discover that my mouth was filled with fat. No meat. Just fat. So I opened the sandwich only to find that the brisket in my sandwich was 25% meat and 75% charred fat. Tasty. Another in my group had the fried chicken and guessed that they left it in the kitchen for awhile before serving it because the fried crust was soggy.,972,4

The wine list is extensive, so I asked for a reasonable priced bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, nothing too expensive.  I thought he would recommend a 100-150 bottle.  He suggested a bottle that was $450.  I laughed.  He gave me attitude, so I ordered a kettle One martini.  After that his attitude and service changed.  The other server was nice and more helpful.  I ordered a Rib eye on the bone.  Extremely rare cut and it was delicious.  But the whole dining experience was tainted by the stuck up waiter.  We ate the next night at Hugo's Cellar at the Four Queens and had a terrific dinner.",565,5

Being in town for 1 night in a hotel with no car, and reading the great reviews on yelp I thought for sure I'd have a knockout meal that'd be delivered to my door. Boy, was I disappointed. Try as I might I just couldn't enjoy much of this meal. 

I wanted to try a bit of everything so I ordered a regular slice, a stuffed slice, a side salad and some buffalo wings. Here are the pros/cons of this meal:

PROS:
- friendly service, from the person taking the order to the delivery guy
- quoted delivery time was met (45-1hr), delivery guy even gave me a ring to give me a heads up he was about to arrive
- salad was good and fresh
- portion sizes definitely match the price, the slices are BIG, toppings were plentiful

CONS:
- wings were a bit overcooked and tough
- the stuffed slice was dry, almost like a pressed panini
- holy salt lick batman, both slices were so incredibly salty that my mouth and tongue were left numb. You can barely taste the toppings, especially in the stuffed slice which probably had an entire shakers worth of salt in it by the taste. 

Maybe it's much much much better if you dine in, I can only hope so. But based on my experience, once is enough for me.",5140,4

Damon's is essentially Applebee's, which is essentially TGI Friday. They all have their theme variations, but their menu focuses around the same thing: ""American"" food(meat & potatoes). The quality of the food here isn't so great, but it tastes good - mostly due to an overabundance of salt in each dish. Beware this food if you enjoy your health.

The sandwiches here will run you about $9, some of the more specialty items will go up to $15. Some things can get higher, but at that point why didn't you pick a better place to go? Their sides are about $3, that's what I usually build my lunch around if I go.

This Damon's has a lot of TVs, I can usually see about 8 when I sit in the bar area, and they all have a variety of sports channels on. The bar staff is pretty nice and they're pretty prompt, even when it's crowded.

I really wouldn't come here at all except when coworkers are going, even most of those times I turn them down.

685,2,The fairways were very skimpy with many bare spots. Lots of desert rough. Even a ball in the fairway might end up in a bad lie. Even the employee working that day admitted the course was less than adequate. According to my playing partner the course was nice at one time. Don't take a nice set of clubs there. The grass was very thin. I wouldn't recommend this course even if it was less 40 for an am tee time. Very few golfers even at 11 am; apparently the message has gotten out regarding the current course conditions.,6,4

693,2,"Today I stopped by this newly opened taco place because I like supporting local businesses and I like tacos. I felt like having some fish and shrimp tacos,  so that is what I ordered.  First,  my shrimp taco was delicious! It was served exactly how is was stated on the menu, ""shrimp sautéed in a guajillo sauce on a bed of red Mexican rice."" This shrimp taco was delicious, but I felt it could have been better if there was some kind of greens like a slaw or chunky salsa to add some freshness to it and take it over the top.  Second, the fish taco was not served how it was stated on the menu.  . . ""Beer battered tilapia on a bed of cabbage topped with Baja sauce and mango salsa."" When I received my fish taco it was NOT beer batter,  more like steamed tilapia,  and it did NOT have the Baja sauce. Also, the mango salsa tasted more like pineapple salsa.  If the fish taco was served like it was stated on the menu, then it would have been delicious as the shrimp taco instead it was underwhelming. For what I was served,  I felt that I was overcharged especially since the menu was misleading.   Overall this place has a nice dining area with a bar where you can sit at and some flat screen TV's.",4653,4
700,2,"This is an updated Review. Since my last review the owner has responded and stated that their prices are not as low as fast-food. Which is interesting because every part of the ordering process is fast food. You walk up to the counter order your meal they ask you for here or to go and they give you a number. They do bring you your food or call out for to go orders. Also like fast food you go to a soda machine. Everything is served in disposable paper products on an aluminum tray. 

The decor is industrial. All the seating is bolted to the ground. Stools and benches are your seating options. Nothing with you sit back and relax in. The counter people were nice.

 I spent $13 on a combo. I ordered the little leaguer with cheese fries and a soda. The beef hot dog was greasy I should have requested turkey dog. The chili was bland and you really couldn't fast the difference in a regular bun vs kings Hawaiian rolls. The cheese fries were good I'd get them again. Basically out of the combo that is all I would get. So the review went from a 1 star to a 2 star that's just because of the fries.",3170,4

717,2,"Okay so surprise surprise, I'm giving Hooters a shitty review.  

I'm ashamed to say that I actually walked into a Hooters.  What is funny is I was here to see Todd Paul's show (completely underrated and the best value on Vegas right now), and I was hungry and had no time to go across to MGM and find something better.  Hooters, was really the only choice to go except for the Mad Onion, which had horrible reviews so I was scared to go there.  So here I was, embarrassed to be waiting in line to try supposedly good wings.

I ordered 10 wings hot, but weren't in the slightest bit hot and were breaded, a big no no with me.  I didn't find out until after that I could have gotten them without the breading, but oh well.  They weren't that good.  The chicken itself was moist and would have been great if it had been naked and with an actual hot sauce.  They charge you extra for blue cheese which is in a small prepackaged container (99 cents), and for celery (79 cents).  However, the most pleasant aspect of this meal was the celery as it was the freshest, most delicious, and huge portion of celery I have had served with wings.  I loved the celery so much I had them take away the wings and I devoured the entire plate of that good crunchy healthy celery.

Also had the curly fries which were good.  I don't normally eat curly fries because they have seasoned salt on them but I liked these.  Husband had a grilled hot dog that didn't seem grilled and cheese sticks that he said were decent.  

Would we go here again?  Doubtful, but we will be back in the casino to see Todd Paul.  I was utterly floored when next to us there was a table with a woman who was celebrating her birthday with her husband there and two friends.  I'm guessing it was the husband's idea to go there.  My husband saw it and said, ""If I take you here for your birthday you have my permission to divorce me.""",2036,4

the two stars it received is for the decor -- which can only be described as modern cheap -- and the excellent service. my waitress was great. the other stars it did NOT receive is because the spicy tuna roll was old as in stale rice. not to mention, the pork in the noodles was much like those cartoon characters you see eating an old shoe out of hunger.

Ich hatte im Vorfeld telefonisch einen Tisch reserviert und wunderte mich noch, dass der Herr am Telefon sich gar nicht für meinen Namen interessierte. Nun gut, dachte ich, wird schon klappen. Wir kamen pünktlich um 19:30 an: Lokal war bis auf den letzten Platz voll. Wir wurden erstmal angestarrt, nach dem Motto: Was wollen die denn hier? Es kam dann doch ein Kellner auf uns zu, dem ich meine Reservierung mitgeteilt habe. Leider seien alle Tische besetzt, wir sollten uns doch ein wenig gedulden. Wir standen also in der Ecke und warteten. Nach 15 Minuten fragte ich den Herrn, wie es denn sein könne, dass es trotz Reservierung keinen Tisch für uns gäbe. Er meinte, er könne ja auch nichts dafür, wenn die Leute so lange essen und nicht aufstehen, rausschmeißen könne er sie auch nicht. Der nächste freie Tisch sei unserer. Na schön, nach einer knappen halben Stunde war es dann soweit. Endlich! Kein Wort der Entschuldigung oder des Eingestehens, einen Fehler gemacht zu haben! Kein Aperitif als Wiedergutmachtung - nichts! Wäre es nicht Freitag abend gewesen (und somit die Chance gering woanders einen Tisch zu bekommen), wären wir sofort aus dem Lokal rausgegangen. Es wurde hektisch die Tischdecke gewechselt. Die Wartezeiten zu den einzelnen Gängen (ausgenommen Dessert - das ging seltsamerweise schnell) waren viel zu lang. Wir hatten einen Riesenhunger (auch schon durch die Wartezeit in der Ecke). Zu meiner Fischsuppe wurde erstmal kein Brot serviert, ich musste ihn darauf aufmerksam machen. Das Hauptgericht hat auch ewig lang gedauert. Für meine Tischnachbarin, die keine Vorspeise wollte, war das fast nicht auszuhalten. Der Thunfisch war qualitativ sehr gut, aber leider nur lauwarm. Salat war o.k., aber nichts besonderes. Dessert war in Ordnung.
Bedienung war sehr hektisch von Anfang an bis zum Bezahlen. Es wurde erstmal mit den Augen gerollt, als wir getrennte Rechnungen verlangten. Auch zum Schluss kein Wort des Bedauerns oder Fehlereingestehens. Stattdessen beim Vorbeigehen dumme Kommentare, wie ""jetzt lachen Sie doch mal"".
Wohlfühlcharakter: gleich Null! Hoher Geräuschpegel, hektische Bedienungen, Ambiente: bürgerlich bis schäbig. Parkplatzsituation: sehr schlecht.

The service was good and everyone seemed friendly. My issue with this place is the hot dog. Each time I've had one the hot dog had a great deal of toughness to it. At first I thought the hot dog was just overlooked or burnt but the menu/site claims that ""all-natural casing"" is used on the hot dog and maybe that's what the problem is.

829,2,"My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night about a week or so ago. We walked right into our table, and we immediately noticed a bit of a smell...like at a Chinese supermarket, but it didn't bother us too much. The restaurant was empty at 6, but the tables filled up by 6:30. The service was great as the server always checked to ensure everything was going well.

Some of my friends started with Beerlao, which is a beer from a Lao brewery and apparently, it is not always available at the restaurant. I tried a little and it is very light; at only 4%, it hardly tastes like alcohol.

Since it was the first time at Sabai Sabai for most of us, the 6 of us ordered all of their curries, plus holy basil stir-fried shrimp and Northern Thai pork skewers. 

* Khao soi: This was my first time trying khao soi. I thought the soup was good, but the deep-fried egg noodles tasted a little stale.
* Panang curry: My favourite out of all four curries. I drenched my rice with the sauce and it was delicious. 
* Green curry: It was okay, although I am not a big fan to begin with.
* Massaman curry: I liked the tenderness of the beef. The sauce is similar to their khao soi. 
* Stir-fried shrimp: I did not try this.
* Pork skewers: It tastes just like the BBQ pork (叉燒) you get at Chinese BBQ shops. 

I must say...the portions were a LOT smaller than I had expected. When the server came with the first curry dish, I thought one of us had added an appetizer, but nope! Sadly, it was one of our main dishes. The curries are decent - not too heavy, thick, or spicy - but they don't scream ""wow!"" and at $9 for the pork skewers, I'm pretty sure I can get a whole pound of BBQ pork at a BBQ shop in Chinatown. 

Sabai Sabai is the only place I know in the area that serves the classic Thai mango sticky rice dessert. It just so happened that it was their dessert of the day. Sweet sticky rice covered in coconut sauce and topped with fresh mango...mmm... Now I want to go back just to have it again!

In all seriousness though, I think I really would only return for their mango sticky rice dessert. I understand that it is a tapas restaurant, but I can't justify paying the price for such incredibly small portions. (It ended up being about $30/person and I was only half full.)",8205,4

Fish Tacos : This is tough cause Toronto is filled with pretty good mexican joints now, so this doesn't even compete. Just feels like a watered down/safe version of what good fish tacos should be. Really lacks that kick. 

Beef Ribs:  Flavor is pretty good, but pricey for the amount of you get. Meat was really thin. 

Teriyaki Sliders: Delicious! The meat had lots of great flavor, plus very moist. The bao complimented the meat well. Very good use of wasabi sauce. Worth the price!

The mac and cheese was creamy and flavorful and the asparagus was fresh. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer which was good too - nice and crispy with just the right amount of seasoning.

I also noticed the containers they serve in are smaller than before.  I guess to trick us into thinking we're getting the same amount.  ""Oh wow!  I must have been super hungry to eat all that food when it's usually enough for two meals.""

Which- fine- we'll live. but it was WAY too hot in their. they kept shoving more people in there and with all the lights and movement it was uncomfortable.

Langfassung: Wir waren zu viert da, und als wir kamen war das Restaurant etwa zur Hälfte besetzt. Da war noch alles in Ordnung. Wir haben zügig unsere Getränke bekommen, und auch die Vorspeisenplatte war recht zügig da. Die Bedienung hat sich auch Zeit genommen, uns zu erklären, was auf der Vorspeisenplatte was ist. (Warnung an dieser Stelle: Die Vorspeisenplatte für 2 Personen war für 4 Leute absolut ausreichend!) Ab da ging alles schief, denn es trudelte eine Gruppe ein, die den Rest des Lokals besetzte. Bei dieser Gruppe wurden Bestellungen aufgenommen, und diese Gruppe bekam Essen. Wir nicht. Auch nachbestellte Getränke kamen nicht. Die Handvoll Servicekräfte war vollkommen überfordert. Als wir nachfragten, bat man uns um Verständnis, weil die Gruppe vorbestellt hatte. Die Bedienung ging aber davon aus, wir hätten wenigstens den Vorspeisensalat bekommen; wir verneinten  und wenige Minuten später hatten wir wenigstens wieder etwas zu Essen auf dem Tisch. Als die Gruppe gegessen hatte und wieder gegangen war, bekamen wir dann auch endlich unser Essen. Es war sehr ordentlich und schmackhaft. Die lange Wartezeit war es eher nicht wert. Ich hatte die Nr. 74 mit Lammfleisch, das leider etwas zäh geworden war.
Das Chaos im Service setzte sich fort, obwohl das Lokal etwa halbleer blieb. Wir beobachteten Leute, die kamen und bestellen wollten  aber nach einiger Zeit wieder gingen, weil sich niemand kümmerte. Der Raki, den wir als Entschädigung bekamen, war leider warm; an einem anderen Tisch ging es auch kalt. Bezahlen war erwartungsgemäß eine weitere Geduldsprobe.
Im Laufe des Abends ist mir noch aufgefallen, daß es im Lokal mehrfach nach Zigarettenrauch roch. Es war aber kein Raucherbereich o.ä. erkennbar. Jedenfalls war es äußerst unangenehm.",7195,4

The service was so good, you really didn't notice it after placing your order.  T-bone steak was delicious.

Saturday was a train wreck.  Service was poor and neglectful, with some personnel poorly groomed.  Cadaveric managers hovered around the tables, but did little to help staff.  The corkage policy abruptly changed, costing us more.  Lamb chops were unseasoned as far as I could tell.

997,2,"The Holidays are a time to enjoy and celebrate with family. They are also a time to catch up on my writing. The next few reviews are a few months old now.... sorry for the delays. First up, I got a chance to visit Industria Brasserie Italienne for a mini McGill Football alumni get-together for homecoming. The results of the weekend weren't as we hoped on the field but I hoped at least I would get to enjoy a good meal at a place I'd had on my list for a while.

Located right in the epicentre of the Griffintown boom at the corner of Peel and Wellington, Industria is a project started by the Houston restaurant chain and chef Sergio Mattoscio - formerly of Macaroni Bar. Since first opening in Griffintown, they have opened a couple of other franchises in Montreal and Ottawa. The concept, according to them, is a modern pizzeria with an emphasis on sharing plates. Walking in, the venue is very sprawling and is definitely going for an industrial loft style with its high ceilings, metallic chairs, wood topped tables and black leather-ish banquettes. The bar area has plenty of TVs and the dining area has a huge glassed-in wine cellar. Frankly the space didn't work for me - felt way too big and lacked focus. The bar and dining areas feel very distinct and separate. One section to another felt like totally different restaurants. Coupled with the loud music, Industria felt more like a supper club than an Italian Pizzeria. I may be of the age demo who would like that ambience but personally it doesn't do it for me.

As I was drinking my Aperol Spritz, I was hopeful the food would spark my enthusiasm more than the ambience and the decor. The menu focuses on plates to share as well as some pizzas. As a group, we ordered a bunch of the starters to share. A mixed bag overall. The salad of mozzarella di bufala, tomatoes, cucumber, celery and fresh basil was solid with a freshness to the tomatoes and the mozzarella. The fried calamari with spicy mayo felt bland and came off as store bought honestly. They felt overly chewy and lacked seasoning. The meatballs with tomato sauce, ricotta, parmesan and basil were excellent - the meatballs were tender and juicy and the tomato sauce was wonderful. The pulled bacon lollipops with maple reduction had a nice crunch on the outside but the bacon inside was way too soft and mushy in texture. I know it's pulled bacon but it still needed a bit of crunch to really enhance that fatty bacon flavour. The maple reduction brought a nice sweetness level but the texture of the bacon sunk it for most of the table.

As chef Mattoscio is known for his gnocchi poutine, I couldn't come to the restaurant without ordering it. Fried potato gnocchi covered in a light chicken sauce and served with cheese curds that I am pretty sure were mozzarella and not traditional curds, I was left very disappointed in this dish. Flavour-wise, it felt way too rich and yet without much kick to it. I loved the gnocchi themselves but the cheese didn't bring that squeak you want from a poutine and the sauce really didn't do it for me.

Thankfully the pizza finished my meal on a more positive note. I went with the Carnivoro - italian sausage, salumi, bacon, tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella. Wonderful crunch to the crust, a nice zesty tomato sauce, tons of mozzarella and meat toppings, the pizza is the only dish I ordered that I would come back for.

In the end, Industria left me disappointed - the pizza was excellent but the rest of the menu was a mix of disappointed to okay. Add to it a look and ambience that I didn't take to and I left with no real desire to return. Perhaps for a pizza and a drink on happy hour but not sure about a full meal. Industria certainly tried to be a looker but in my case, she just ain't my type.

First off, it isn't very vegetarian friendly, there is only one thing on the menu to choose from: beans on taco. As I can get something similar, more tasty, more authentic, for less in central american or south american places, you simply are disappointed. 
So I didn't try any of the other tacos on the menu (duck, fish, whatever else).  Grunman seems to focus on the local meat stuff.

1013,2,"With over a dozen visits to the Roman Bistro, I have come to the sad realization that a degradation in quality and service accompanied each sequential trek to the restaurant. Quite simply, I think the problem is one of consistency wherein the menu items (and the menu itself) are too variable and too unreliable, tasting and looking from visit to visit. Prior ordered favorites become a memory. This may be traced to different food preparers or ""off days"" in the kitchen. My most recent (and likely last) visit brought forth flatbread which was basically a shingle of matzo cracker with some forlorn chopped veggies aboard with a dollop of dipping sauce. The beet salad, lifeless lettuce partnered with a few canned beets, was sad indeed. I would bet that the chefs/cooks have been in transition and turn over. A place of promise, unfulfilled.",8444,4

We tried two desserts:   strawberry tart and opera cake.   Both were medicore at best. 

The strawberry tart shell - subtracting the strawberries - was so sweet that even the tartness of strawberries could not offer any counter balance.   Too much sugar. 

The opera cake (it's a French dessert but try one in Vienna ...) is distinguished by a delicate balance of bitterness and sweetness between dark chocolate ganache and coffee buttercream.   The sugar content in this version left us no choice but to just leave it after one bite.

63,3,"Everything was great, except for the Veggie Burger.  I recently had dinner and drinks at Luxe for the first time on a Saturday.  Service and atmosphere were top notch.  My salad and small plate meal of Coriander Seared Ahi Tuna were excellent.  My basil and pineapple vodka cocktail was sublime.  One dining companion loved her Fettuccine Alfredo.  My boyfriend (a vegetarian) ordered the Grilled Veggie Burger with goat feta artichoke spread and tomato on challah bread.  While the feta artichoke spread was delicious the veggie patties were clearly Morningstar brand patties sold in grocery stores.  Why not make a handcrafted veggie burger, LUXE?  So many wonderful Cleveland restaurants offer a signature, house made, original veggie patty.  Not offering a vegetarian the same superb cuisine as other diners = only 3 stars.  :(",4017,5
68,3,"I'm giving this restaurant three stars because I thought the food was actually very good. I preferred the sweet waffles to the savory, even with the sandwich fillings. They were light and delicious. Mine had crispy chicken and a really awesome spicy maple syrup. 
The service was a big problem. It was a Saturday night and Westgate was packed; we'd been given up to a two hour wait at some of the other restaurants already and were surprised to see this one only about half full. I thought maybe they were short handed because the poor hostess was single handedly trying to seat customers, bartend, take orders, serve food and apologize to groups who were complaining. I watched her give a free round of drinks to more than one table. I didn't see any other bartender the whole night, and watched several people come in and sit down at the bar then leave after being ignored for more than 20 minutes. We decided against ordering drinks. I tried to get my own water but couldn't find any cups, so I flagged down a bus boy, who must've gotten the waitress' attention finally. I didn't realize she was the waitress because she hadn't moved from the kitchen doorway in the 45 minutes since we'd come in, apparently chatting with one of the cooks. She brought our water without a word and then turned to walk away without even asking if we were ready to order, back to chat at the doorway. We had to call her back. There was one other cook who did appear to be working, just very slowly. It was another hour at least before we had our food. The table next to ours had six people and their plates were served one at a time, with 10 - 15 minutes in between each one.

Other clubs/pool that are on the strip don't even do that to own hotel guests.

81,3,"I have passed by here countless times but never actually stopped in. My mom bought a Groupon for tea time for four and made a reservation. I have heard bad things about using Groupons at various establishments, but as we were seated, our tea was served, and the three tiered serving platter of sandwiches and desserts was placed in front of us, my worries went away. We had a selection of cucumber sandwiches, caprese sandwiches, scones, bread pudding, and mini s'mores. Not to mention the unlimited flavored teas (bagged). We were seated in a room on the second floor which was decorated nicely for Christmas and had a small electric fireplace turned on. Everything was good and we enjoyed ourselves until our waitress asked to see the Groupon. She studied it for a while in front of us which made me nervous. Then the bill came. When my mom made the reservation, she mentioned the Groupon and was told that tax and 20% gratuity wasn't included. Fine, sounds typical. Our bill, however, was charged the tax and gratuity for the regular price of tea, not the Groupon price. When my mom asked the woman at the register about this, she laughed and said we should have been told that it was off the regular price and they wouldn't even do a Groupon otherwise. Boy, how silly of us, right? But guess what-we weren't told and to be honest we think it was that woman who made the reservation for us. I don't have patience for establishments that try to ""pull a fast one"" to get business. And judging from some of the other reviews, can you afford the bad press? I truly doubt we were the first to make a reservation with a Groupon so why not be up front from the beginning and give all the details? We still would have come and I would have given a better review. Sorry, I won't be back.",6543,1

Delivery driver blamed it on having to wait on the restaurant - but I'm not completely certain where the disconnect was since my hotel is within walking distance.  Chicken Korma was the blandest I have ever eaten - but the Chicken Tikki Masala was very redeeming.  I ordered both at medium heat, so it was really surprising to have one be so flavorful and the other so bland.  Naan was very cold by the time my order arrived.

Food's decent, the wait can be long, the service can suck, it's a toss up.

I've had a really lousy server experience here once, it was extremely disappointing - waitress pretty much told me and my friend (both of us girls) that two pizzas would be too much food for us - RUDE and made a comment about how we almost came close to finishing them both off - EVEN MORE RUDE... then took 30 minutes to bring the bill. I spoke with the manager who neither apologized nor made any effort to resolve the issue. Charming.

97,3,"Went to Richardson's again tonight as it's one of my favorite restaurants for the past 10 years. Horrible experience tonight as we made a reservation late for 6 p.m. and they said all they had was on their patio. I specifically asked if they had misters and they said YES. So off we went and when we were seated the misters weren't on, so we asked for them to be turned on. They did, but they they kept turning them off. When we continued to ask why they were off they said others where complaining they were dripping on them. The only other patrons were ones at the bar waiting for their inside tables. We had 6 people and our bill was almost $400. At the end the waitress asked how everything was and we asked for our check so we could leave as we were all VERY hot (misters were off for the last 30 minutes of our meal). She apologized and told us it was a ""liability"" to have the misters on and that someone had reserved the ""pit"" on the patin and paid $500 as a deposit and they didn't want the misters on. As we walked out of the restaurant and left a 15% tip instead of our normal 25% (she lost $30) we saw NO ONE else eating in the ""pit"" area, only 4 or 5 people standing around and the floor was completely dry. Very disappointed that we were told outside would have misters, which the few times they were on made a BIG difference and that the few bar patrons were more important than our table of six, with drinks, apps, $35 entrees. We will definitely rethink heading back to Richardson's after this experience no matter how good the food is.........since we had to take 50% of the food home as it was too uncomfortable to eat.",4581,1

It took forever for her to even come back. I asked if they can take $1 off or give me a wing and they ended up giving me 3 wings. We were done with our food and we still waited at least another 10 mins for her to come around! I didn't see her in the dining area so I don't know if she was smoking out back or what.

I went around 12:45PM, peak lunch hour, to find a line about 5 people deep and only one person behind the counter taking orders, and he was moving very slowly (without purpose). One person was on the register, another was cutting up toppings, and there was another just standing around. After everyone in front of me was served, the employee standing around finally jumped in. I could tell he was new because he was timid, but the problem was that there also was no nearby supervisor guiding him, so it took awhile to take and finalize my order. I got my food in the end, but the whole process took much longer than it should have.

As for the food, this time I ordered the Super Kingpin with black beans and green peppers. It was actually very good and strong enough to hold it's innards.

On a recent visit I decided to try their veggie burger, I ordered it with lettuce, onion and pickles. I had a hard time deciding if this was a Morning Star Farms offering or house made. If it was a frozen patty, shame on them. True burger joints need to show the vegans and vegetarians that Red Robin wants their business and should make an in house patty. The waiter could not answer my question regarding to my inquiring if their meatless burger was house made or frozen. It wasn't bad though. 

In my pre- vegan days I loved the monster burger and endless fries.

136,3,"We have been coming here off and on ever since this place opened.  We have seen a high turn over in servers over the more recent years and today I understand why. We ordered 2 diet cokes with our meal in to go cups.  We stood at the counter and watched the girl fill our drinks as we thought we would save her the trouble of bringing them to the table.  She filled up the first to go cup with regular coke and put a lemon in it (which, I think, usually goes into a diet coke). So we thought maybe this isn't our order.  We watched as she filled the second to go cup with regular coke and again put a lemon in it. Hummm, surely this must not be our order.  
She turned around, we told her we were waiting for 2 diet cokes, and even asked, Are those diet cokes? and she starts to hand them to us.  I told her, we just watched you fill them with regular coke.  She just smiled, never said I'm sorry...or... oh I made a mistake...or... isn't that a funny joke to switch regular coke and diet coke, nothing.  She emptied them out and filled them with diet coke as we watched her.  After we sat down, another waitress came over and was very apologetic but with servers like the one who thinks it's funny to fill orders with coke when diet coke was ordered, we probably will not go back.

Our waitress clearly forgot to enter our dinner order as after 75 minutes I pointed out to her that we had not even seen or salads yet. She should have noticed this herself. So technically this should be a one or two star review but I think and hope this is just a start up issue because we really like the location, accessability by water on Lake Wylie and most of all the food.

145,3,"We recently (ok, a little over a year ago) moved very close to this PF Chang's location. My two sons absolutely adore Chinese food and have been bugging me to go try it out (never been to a PF Chang's). 

1st Visit - we were told the wait would be 20 minutes but it was only 5, which of course is a bonus. Our waitress was a long, dark brown-haired lady, maybe in her 40s to early 50s (don't hate, I'm a terrible judge of age!!). She was absolutely fantastic. She recommended meals, her service was awesome, and she had a wonderful sense of humor. We had the crispy green beans, crab wontons, and spring rolls for appetizers. For our entrées we ordered Mongolian beef, sweet-and-sour chicken, and Chang's spicy chicken (no, we don't eat that much in one sitting and planned to take some home!!). Our food was fantastic and we left very happy.

2nd Visit (3 weeks later) - again we were told we would have a 20 to 25 minute wait but really only waited 10 minutes. Our waitress was a younger girl maybe in her young 20s. This time around the food was just okay, like maybe they got a new chef?? We skipped appetizers this time and just got soup. I ordered the Mongolian beef the first time, and my younger son absolutely loved it, so that was what he had his mind set on for on this trip. He is a young chef in training, and I consider his palette very particular...which is why I was urged to try his food when he said he wasn't too happy with it. I did, and he was absolutely right. It tasted nothing like it did the first time. My older son ordered Chang's Kung Pao and it had ZERO spice. I ordered the Crispy Honey chicken and was disappointed. It was mostly breading with very little chicken, and was overly sweetened. The service was decent - I'd say a 7/10. We had our leftovers packaged up and came home.

3rd Visit (Valentines Day) - once more we were told we would have a long wait - 30 to 40 minutes. We decided to take the buzzer and sit in the car since it was pretty crowded in that lobby. 8 minutes later, the buzzer rang so we went inside (I really think they need to polish up the wait time quotes!). Our waiter this time was Scott. He seemed pretty inattentive for not being too busy. We ordered soup again and each had a bowl. I ordered the coconut curry vegetables this time as I am a BIG coconut fan. The taste was pretty good but I did have to ask for more sauce as the vegetables were very lightly coated. My younger son again, did go for the Mongolian beef. It was much better this time. My older son went back to the Chang's spicy chicken that he had the first time. He said it was good, but definitely much better the first visit. Can the first visit chef please step forward??? We want to come only when you're there!!! Since we had just gone to a movie (with snacks - I know, we did that backwards!) right before dinner we weren't very hungry. So we asked our waiter to box it up and we would take it home. The next day when we went to go into our left overs, there were three tiny boxes of food and one tiny box half full of rice. Where was all our food???? We had each only taken a couple bites (literally), and didn't even touch the rice. The soup was completely left out of the bag. Having spent $70 for dinner I felt this warranted a phone call. I spoke with the manager who assured me that he would look back on the video and see what happened at the end of our meal. He was going to get right back to me. 2.5 days later, I got a phone call from him stating that he couldn't really see what happened in the video feed (what's the point of video if you can't depict what's happening???), and offered a $20 gift card for our inconvenience. Really?? I spend $70 and that's my compensation.

Went back in for wings and a burger and can't believe it was the same place. Wings were awful! The BBQ burger was so bad I could not eat it. Sauce is all wrong, burger was green inside (literally, the meat was green colored) and the onion rings on top were complete mush. Fries were inedible as well. Not sure what happened but not sure I'll go back. The Italian sub is good (really small though) but I will never get wings or a burger again.

Dieses Gericht hatte ich schon einmal.
Beide waren dieses mal kaum gewürzt und es schmeckte komisch. Wir teilten es diesem anschließend mit. Dieser nahm es zur Kenntnis und meinte, er würde es der Küche weiter geben.
Als wir zahlten, reduzierten wir das Trinkgeld natürlich.

The onion rings were ordered as an appetizer and the entire Yelp crew shared two orders of it. They were freakin' delicious! If you come here, you have to try them!! We also ordered the Cajun style shrimp... it was 'meh.' I won't die if I don't have them ever again.

Most of us at the table ordered their Major Burger. It was good, but definitely not something to write home about. The BBQ sauce on the burger was too thick and there was too much of it on the patty. For $7 a pop, it's quite reasonable considering the amount of meat you're getting. I also had the pleasure of having their Jalapeno Cornbread. Yum!

Definitely check it out ... but I'm okay if I don't go back.",5571,5
172,3,"so I made reservation at 5:45, showed up, and told to wait by wait staff because the table is still busy. (sure... there are many other tables available for 1 or 2 ppl)
20 min later I asked, is my table ready, she then looked at the manager, and the manager asked her if I have any reservation. she pointed to my name and he asked for how many ppl, she said 1. and he said only 1!!?
then she seated me to another table (which has been available in the first place)
the place is not a place for enjoying your meal. it is a fusion of mexican argentine and peruvian food. in which the food part is pretty good. just don't order any Taco (they are badly made and not sure why)
the waitress was very nice and describe the food well, she did not recommended the Taco, next time I would try the short ribs or their speciality pork belly.
I wish they lit up the room a bit, too dark and having a waitress to shine a light on the menu or your food so you can see, doesn't help.
Duck Carnitas Empanada was great.",6610,1

The employees were using a booth right out in the open as their personal hangout/ place to eat. They had work paperwork on the table and boxes in the seats. That stuff should be kept in the back and their hangout should be ina break room and not taking up a booth. 

Ordered a beer and the girl who rang it up said she was under 21 and couldn't pour it. The lady who could was helping kids redeem tickets. Waited like 10 minutes, seemed simple to switch places but they didn't seem concerned.

188,3,"Hmm...
I was super excited to try this place after hearing some great reviews.
Came in at 12:30 on  Sunday and our only options were the all you can eat brunch for $15 or the appetizer/burger menu on the back.

Their other menu was huge, but we couldn't have that until 2pm on a Sunday. Bummer.

The beer list looked awesome and had really great deals (compared to where I live, Chicago) $3.50 for a 12 ounce, that is amazing! And flights of beer....sign me up!

I ordered the boneless buff wings in 3 Alarm. They weren't that hot, but still good. The gorgonzola dip tasted great, but just like blue cheese...so not really sure if it's just me who doesn't know my cheese or what...but whatev.

Service was friendly, mac and cheese pizza was on a pita bread and didn't look that amazing--sadly. I could get better mac n cheese pizza in Chicago--regular crust, too.

Burgers came with choice of friends, apple sauce, or coleslaw. You could substitute for Turkey Burger, Boca, Buffalo for $.50 to $1.00.

I would come back here for dinner if I could and get a different entree and try some beers.",1561,5
189,3,"This is the first time I am coming here and I'm not sure if it is because they are new but the workers were all over the place. Being that I have eaten poke at so many places, this is by far the worst as portion control. The food does taste good. I got 4 proteins mixed in after seeing how little they used in the beginning but I will say it does taste fresh.",6382,1
192,3,"My first crack at Caribbean food in Toronto!

Not bad and cheap!  Filling and flavourful.  I really can't say too much because I only tried the one thing on their menu: jerk chicken.

I've never had plantains and oxtail before. I have to say, now I want to eat that with my chicken all the time.  In fact, i bought some plantains the other day so I could make some chicken with those on the side.",5880,1

195,3,"This is a review purely on oysters cause that's what I got. The oysters that I got was $20 -$25 for a dozen including tax and tip. I sat by the bar where we got to see the staff opening the oysters up. It was pretty pricy but wasn't a surprised since we were in the middle of the dessert so it is probably hard to get seafood out there. Anyways I was extremely surprised by how fresh the oysters tasted and no sand!! I'm not exactly sure what the different oysters were because we got a mixed but I enjoyed them all. 

My friend ordered Manhattan Clam Chowder and did not enjoy it very much. It was red/orange and looked like a tomato soup. She actually said it tasted more tomato than clam chowder. 

The restaurant is pretty small, the kitchen is right in front of you. If you sit by the bar you watch then make everyone else's dish. I guess this is why some of the other food isn't as amazing like some people were expecting because I don't think they had a specialize chef for some of the food. I saw like some guy who looked like the manager and other stuff help cook the food.",4238,1

201,3,"We went to the Yard house before the Coyotes game. We always like to sit at the bar. Our server Kaitlyn was very pleasant. We ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was good, but a few too many shells in it. My husband ordered a bacon cheeseburger and subbed a side of mashed potatoes. When it came out the potatoes were the size of a small ice scream scoop. It was laughable.  He ordered a side of steamed vegetables, and he got Asian vegetables. Kind of weird with a burger. My French onion soup was lukewarm at best. The turkey in my Cobb salad was tough. I pushed it aside. The rest of the salad was good. What saved the dinner was the hot brownie dessert with vanilla ice cream. Yummmmm.",8457,5

I am originally from Las Vegas and very familiar with the restaurants high level of customer service and have had incredible meals at haakasan in the past, so I was of course disappointed this ended weakly.  
I made the reservation for 7.15pm through Takoda, who has made my reservations in the past .  He is always a pleasure to work with and answers promptly .  We were greeted by a couple very sweet and beautiful hostesses and actually decided to sit at the bar and have a more causal dinner that way.  The bar was completely empty, score right ? The bartender was cool and helped us out right away .  We ordered a cocktail , Budda's Palm ($22 cocktail!) which was amazing as usual then we ordered food ... Food came out quick ! The ribeye stir fry was so delicious and melted in your mouth!! We had a small bite , bacon, bean something roll , which was great at first bite ... The second bite I had was surprisingly crunchy, so much so , I couldn't actually bite through the green bean, odd right ? Well of course it was difficult as it wasn't a bean at all , it was a toothpick !!! I would have mentioned it to the bartender ; however , she was gone and the other 2 behind the bar were conversing.  Our bartender pretty much disappeared after that and the other bartender was focusing on another couple... 10 minutes later he finally comes over and we order dessert, chocolate mint and espresso .. Cake comes out no espresso no bartender .  The service started out strong but ended so weak and on top of that I had a toothpick baked into my very expensive small dish! Bummed out !",2609,5
217,3,"As with ALL Chinese buffets, you have to home in on the items that they do best & keep going back for more...

Das Art Sushi liegt im Stuttgarter-Westen. Es ist eher ein Lieferdienst als ein Restaurant. Es bietet zwar Tische an, allerdings wird am laufenden Band Sushi zum Liefern verpackt. Dementsprechend ist auch das Ambiente. Die Auswahl an Sushi ist gut, geschmacklich war es aber eher durchschnittlich. Dafür ist der Preis zu hoch.
Als Lieferdienst sicherlich gut, aber um gemütlich Sushi Essen zu gehen, empfehle ich in Stuttgart weitaus bessere Alternativen.
Bedienung
Die Bedienung ist nett, allerdings nichts besonderes, wie Empfehlungen.
Das Essen
Gegessen wurde Maki mit gegrillter Lachs, Gurke, Sesam, California Inside Out mit Sesam (Surimi, Avocado, Gurke, Sesam) und Surimi Maki sowie Nigiri Sake (Lachs), Nigiri Ebi( Garnele), Nigiri Tamago (japanisches Omelett) und 2x Miso Suppe (Tofu,Seetang,Lauchzwiebel).
Die Suppe hat für uns wie eine Fertigsuppe geschmeckt. Das Sushi selbst war in Ordnung, allerdings nichts besonderes. Auf den California Inside Out Rollen war geröstete Zwiebeln drauf, die meiner Meinung nach überhaupt nicht dazu gepasst haben.
Das Ambiente
Kleines Restaurant, da doch eher ein Lieferdienst. Kein asiatisches Ambiente.

I stop at Jimmy Johns  occasionaly for lunch or dinner. Jimmy John's convenient location & excellent service keeps me coming back. The food at Jimmy Johns is fresh, the service is fast,  and the prices are great.

I have to admit I like Jimmy Johns.  The restaurant are always clean every time I visit, which is really important. One of the things I like best about Jimmy John's is that they  slice their own meat and bake their own bread; now that is what I call freshness. 

The atmosphere at Jimmy John's is great, the signs on the walls are very funny.  The subs are super filling and they only cost $4.50.

244,3,"Just not what it used to be.

I've been going to Schwartz's since I was a young child, and have watched the quality slip steadily over the last 5 years. It's been most notable since Celine Dion bought it. The brisket just doesn't have the same flavour it used to, and it's often dry and stringy. Still a solid sandwich, but certainly not worth the line-up when there is one.",2733,1
245,3,"I originally wanted to go to Weera Thai after hearing good things about it and seeing wonderful photos and reviews, but ended up coming here with my fiancée who bought a Groupon for this place. We ordered the pad Thai, masaman curry with chicken and fried tofu, and garlic beef. The pad Thai was okay, nothing special. It had shrimp in it that obviously we're not fresh. The masaman curry had a good flavor, and it was my favorite item. No complaints. The garlic beef however....was so chewy I ended up having to swallow the pieces practically in their original form. I could not masticate them if I tried. Which I did, for around 5 minutes before my jaw started hurting. The flavor was good, but the quality of the beef was terrible. Terrible. I would not return unfortunately, but I look forward to trying Weera Thai down the street from here.",7163,1

 The restaurant proclaims to love burgers. They also love eggplant parmigiana. The eggplant parmigiana burger is a large sandwich featuring eggplant parmigiana between two round buns. For eggplant parmigiana lovers such as myself, this was heaven for my taste buds. 
  The fries are served separate from the sandwiches.  Expect to pay $20 for an eggplant parmigiana burger or basic burger sandwich, fries, and bottomless soda. The higher-end burgers cost as high as $17. What is kind of cool is having ranch dressing come with the fries.
   I Love Burgers was happening. I felt that the service was satisfactory.",96,5

I hope they put some serious thought in improving the service because the food is boss!",3847,1
265,3,"NOT a place for toddlers and young kids. So, you think 'butterflies'.. that's a 'little kid' thing??   It really isn't for small children and especially for how expensive it is.  It's a crime for this place to charge what they do for parents to bring in small kids who one: will never remember this place and two:  can't behave well enough to be there.  There were three different parents who had to take their '5 and under' children out during the movie.  It's an educational film.  The other small kids who remained were obnoxious- talking WAY out loud as though they were in their living rooms. But kids 2 and under are free.  I have no idea why they are actually encouraging parents to bring kids this young.

  It's obnoxiously expensive for what it is.  Yes, the butterfly atrium is cool... but MANY butterflies on the path, and I saw three murdered by small children not watching where they were going, and they just tromped right on 'em.  Not worth the almost TWENTY dollars for an adult.  The aquarium part is nothing beyond something you see in your dentist's office.  All of the Mini stingrays were lying on the bottom of their tank and the guy said, ""Oh, they're nocturnal"".  Really?  They aren't at the zoo... and if they actually are then why put them in an exhibit open during the DAY? 

Be prepared for the almost 'Hitchcock' feel of the butterfly atrium.  If this type of thing creeps you out, steer clear.  This is NOT like the Botanical garden butterfly exhibit where butterflies are sitting mostly on plants.   These are flying all over the place.  Cool to some- creepy to others.

  So, long story short- take an international student whose never seen a butterfly OR a special older person who can appreciate the process, can read the exhibits and can enjoy the beauty that this small place offers. 

 I can't believe I just spent almost 80.00 for a family of four for about 90 minutes of somewhat interesting activity.    I can't imagine this place lasting at these prices. Although, it was very crowded- so, who am I to say.",595,1

Ever since the opening of the new location, the owner stopped being on site here and it really shows. Ordering over the phone is a nightmare and you can almost always guarantee the order will not be accurate. The young staff that works here doesnt seem to care much about being friendly and giving the same customer service the did when the owner was on site. We have been eating here since they opened and would do really large orders for our entire staff. Now everyone in our office stays away because of how many mistakes they always make and the timing it takes to get the food. We understand that all restaurants have a lunch rush, but sometimes its 30 minutes or more for a simple sandwich. I really hope the owner sees this review and gets a good solid manager to be on site who gets this place back on track. I will then give them another chance and update my review as warranted.",6929,5

The most important thing about any kind of grill from the Balkans is the freshness and quality of the meat.  Best grill is made from meat that was slaughtered in the last 24 hours. This meat was obviously not fresh neither of high quality.

Our party ordered a few more items which were ok , but the quality of the meat was a real letdown.",4332,5
285,3,"Ouch!  Usually this would be at LEAST a 4-star review from me.  When I worked in Cornelius I used to go to Zapatas a few times a week for what we liked to call ""Mexican Therapy"" lunches.

I was so excited when my (new) boss asked if we wanted to do a late lunch at Zapatas this past week in Ballantyne.

We were seated fast, asked for waters and a chance to look over the menu, given chips and salsa, delivered waters, and were left there for 25 minutes.  One of the women at my table physically got up and got us napkins.  Then about 10-15 minutes later she walked over and asked them to take our order.  It was crazy.  All three of the waiters were sitting in the back (within eye-shot), but just didn't come over to our table.

So we got our food pretty fast and then were brought one check.  We put our cards out-they just sat there.  When one of the guys came over to fill up our waters we asked him to please take the check even though he wasn't our waiter.  Poor thing had no idea what we were asking him to do.  Finally we wrapped everything up and got out of there within 1.5 hours.

I still give this place a 3 stars because I honestly believe that maybe they were just having an off day.  Even my boss, who goes there at least 2 times a week said that this was strange for them.

The food is great--I always get disappointed when Mexican Restaurants don't serve tamales, but it's cheap and usually pretty fast service.

Do I come here for the best tasting tacos and burritos in town?

I'D SAY NAY!

This place is super average. I came here recently and the carnitas tacos I infrequently get were, yet again, dry. They desperately needed the awesome green sauce this establishment makes to add much needed moisture and flavor. One of the few places in town that has spicy and flavorful green sauce.

The carne asada burrito I got was fully loaded and quite filling. But as usual,  the meat inside was dry and had the taste of hanging out in a heat warming bin for too long.

So why have I kept coming back for over a decade? Because they uphold a trinity of being consistent, cheap, and always being open 24/7. I can spend less than $15 and be full for the whole day, the tacos and burritos have always stayed average, and they have always been open when I was a broke high school student, a broke college student, and now as a broke working professional paying back his student loans.

I like this place and I'll keep coming back here. It serves cheap and and decent tasting Mexican food, 24/7. It's as simple as that.",4481,5

And since I like a good deli sandwich we decided to stop and check out and see what they had. As you walk in its very hole in the wall in its decor. Pictures of menu items on the wall and that's pretty much it. This place was crazy busy. We were sat immediately and drink order taken (yay). We got the Pastrami on rye to share with fries. Sandwich was of good portion for 2 people to share. Fries were normal house fries. The meat was tender and good for any carnivore to enjoy. It did take a bit to get the attention of the staff to get a refill and our bill. They get busy and possibly understaffed.

What I don't love is the service. It never fails that we order for either delivery or pick up and something gets screwed up. 

We ordered salads and cheesy garlic bread for delivery one time and the salads came, but no bread. We called, they promised to credit our next order. Never got a credit.

We ordered pizza (multiples) one time and delivery was going to be TWO hours. I know they're busy, but come on. So I chose to pick it up instead. They told me 45 minutes. I got there and it wasn't even cooked yet. I waited there for 30 minutes before it was ready. I had a ton of hungry guys at my house waiting on this pizza!!

Last night was the last straw - we ordered an antipasto salad and chicken parm. We picked it up and get it home and we're missing a whole bag... no dressing for the antipasto salad and no dinner salad or dressing to go with the chicken parm.

So I ordered the Fish and chips for $10.00. The dish has four halibut-fillets battered with beer and cooked to a golden brown with a side of curly fries. Nothing too fancy about the fish dish.  I also had two Cranberry and Vodka drinks for $8.00 each. The price of the cocktails seems questionable. I hope the bartender uses good vodka for my drinks. 

The bar also have a special on a 144 oz pitcher of beer starting at $20.00 for domestic beer and more for imported. With a huge selection of beers, I might try that one day to along with that B3 burrito, in which many of you are disappointed that I didn't try.

I did enjoy the stuffed dates, the almond in the center was a nice surprise! I would come back one of these days because there is one right by my condo and try more of the items",7025,5

366,3,"For dinner or lunch, El Rodeo and other Mexican joints like this one are usually not my thing. I like fresh ingredients and typically - or every time I've been to any El Rodeo - they just don't seem to serve fresh anything. 

Last night, was a different story.

My sister and I were out shopping. We were both in fitting rooms complaining about how everything we tried on looked terrible and then whined about how huge our guts are. Then we talked about food and how awesome it is. And then my sister decided she wanted fried ice cream. So, of course, to drown our chubby sorrows we went to El Rodeo.

The place was dead. We were seated immediately and served the freshest chips and salsa I've ever had at any El Rodeo. They were seriously just fried and the slightest bit of grease was still left on them. SO GOOD!

We ordered the ""supreme"" fried ice cream. It comes in a fried tortilla covered in cinnamon sugar. This was also VERY fresh - it was just made. I have never experienced two fresh items in a row at El Rodeo so I was more than pleasantly surprised.

We guessed that since it was almost 9:00 pm they were making things fresh for the next day. So maybe timing is everything? 

Thank you, El Rodeo, for making my gut even flabbier. Just what I needed.",4481,5
369,3,"2013 Update - Draft Beer ? Still bad service... but...

I have found 1 friendly person who works the self serve check out... the rest are moody and miserable... so there is a ray of hope on that front.

Wine and Seafood selection still spotty at best... Cheese Monger is helpful and the selection is good.

Newest feature... draft beer? Buy an amber glass Growler for $3.99 and then bring it back for refills... the beer itself is mostly nationally known brands.  We are trying Blue Moon Wheat for a first try since we know we like it.  The produce folks who work the filling station have no clue what the beers are... we may have purchased a couple... but figured we would go one at a time since there was no help on the flavor to be had.

Fuel perks are the only thing that get us coming back... Seafood can be had 7 miles North and Meat can be had 4 miles South on 91 for better quality at the same or lower prices... and don't even think that this bakery is worth a mention... WAY too many better in the area.",1341,5

The first day we order a turnip cake and ask for oyster sauce,  the waitress is really nice and gave it to us.  But the second day,  I order the same dish and ask for the same oyster sauce,  the waitress (another one) said they don't have it and just walk away. She was busy and just don't want to get it for us.  Prior to that, we put in an order and 2mins later ask to cancel it bc we kinda order too much. The same lady said she can't cancel it. Seriously,  it's not like I never been to other restaurant,  if the time is not long they should be able to do it.  But she just don't want to bother; and don't want to walk to the counter and cancel it, we didn't make a big deal and just let it go. But the oyster sauce I really can't eat the turnip cake without it,  so I ask another waiter,  a male one,  he was able to get it for us within a minute .

It was seasoned well but dry because he let it cook too long smh. I probably won't go back unless it's for a birthday because they sing a song, play a drum and throw confetti!

Other than the loud club music, there's not much difference between a ""beach club"" and a regular hotel pool. Except you actually have lounge chairs to place your stuff and sit in, while at a beach club, you can only do that if you buy a table/bottle service, which is dumb imo.  If I had to choose, I'd pick a plastic lounge chair + book + personal iPod, over loud club music + lounge couches + stripper poles in the middle of the pool to dance on.

Tables start off at $300, reaching up to $1800 for a cabana, which the club suggested we get since we had 8 people.  $1800 for a cabana LOL do we look like we're made out of money??

We thought we were ordering the $5 per glass 'happy hour wine'...it was true, we did say ""House Wine""..thinking of course that's what they'd be serving for 'happy hour' prices...so you can imagine our shock when we received a $60 charge for 4 glasses of wine. We spoke to our server, and said that we certainly never meant to order $15 per glass wine (I mean what restaurant serves $15 dollar glasses of wine as ""HOUSE WINE"") She went to the manager and was told ""that's too bad..they drank the wine and they must pay for it""...We asked to speak to the manger..and after some discussion as to our shock ad surprise that we were not served the 'happy hour wine' she agreed to comp $40 off our dinner menu...Now, what was so disturbing and disappointing was that she (the manager) would not just do that when our server told her what happened..It embarrassed our server and made her look unimportant that she could not just 'satisfy' her customer with the 'right thing to do""...

She heard and memorizes only one short word. :/ :/ It was to go, so I was not able to claim right there. I don't like the fact that we cannot easily see how they make the sandwich.

I don't mind this because I enjoy taco bell on occasion.  However, the food will inexplicably be awful sometimes. Once the lettuce tasted completely foul and another time the onions were awful.  The service is the same way. I have ordered a takeout order about 10-15 minutes before arriving and then had to wait an additional 10 minutes for my food once I got there.

I found that the Hash dishes have a large amount of unseasoned cubes of potatoes usually with eggs and a meat of your choice.  If you don't mind eating an overwhelming amount of potatoes (carbs) for breakfast then you are good.

Food was amazing (we had Uncle Vincent's lemon chicken, pasta and Cesar salad), but the service was horrible. Our wait staff was inattentive, didn't take the time to discuss menu items, actually threw salad plates on our table, never asked if we wanted pepper for the salads, more water refills, etc. They were quoting a 45 minute wait with empty tables (although front of the house staff friendly) and the staff looking a bit bored. Never saw a manager checking tables as they should ensure the dining guests are happy. We visited Bouchon the night before (price points are about the same and the difference in service was night and day).

So my friends & I stumble into the Rio last Saturday night and try out their new theater/nightclub: The Crown...the only saving grace from that place is that they hired a pole dancer that actually did more than shake her booty...she did some pole tricks.

This place definitely made my night. There was a good mix of people with a more laid back vibe, which makes for a better experience. The view was killer and the weather was perfect. I'd definitely want to spend another Vegas night here....or at least end it here. You can dance outside on one of their 2 dancefloors and the tunes were just right. The stairs were a bit of a challenge in heels, so next time i'll try and wear something more forgiving on the feet.

Extremely small place, not a lot of room to move around, and definitely not a place that can seat a large party, although we only had 6 people with us, so I don't know that you could consider that to be a large party.

It was a relief when the singer stopped wailing and some old school hip-hop started on the stereo. The band was like bad karaoke of current pop songs and too loud and badly-sung to have a proper conversation and when you're at a bar enjoying some watery cider you should either be able to enjoy the music or the company. When you can't enjoy either it is pretty sad. Please just play regular music!!",1107,1

Wegen der bisherigen ordentlichen Bewertungen haben wir uns kurzfristig entschlossen, Samstag Abend mit Freunden beim Chinesen in Remseck-Hochberg zu speisen.

Vorspeisen: 4x Minifrühlingsrollen mit Sosse, Hauptgerichte: 4x Ente, jeweils mit unterschiedlichen Geschmacksrichtungen (süss/sauer-pikant usw.). Die Speisen waren lieblos auf einer Platte abgelegt. Die 4 Ententeller sahen alle gleich aus, unterschieden sich nur durch die in einem gesonderten Kännchen mitgelieferten Sossen. Dessert: 2x gebackenes Eis mit Honig, riesige Kugeln, Teigummantelung ohne Geschmack. Geschmacklich alles keine Offenbarung. Schade, es gibt für uns keinen Grund, hier wieder einzukehren.

However, what I found offensive is that I asked if I had everything to complete my order and they verified but when I got home there wasn't any sauces and they gave me 4 fortune cookies. It's just odd that you can go to any other Chinese food establishment and you get two meals and they send you home with 12 fortune cookies & a fresh orange, yet this extravagant place is so cheap they give you 4 fortune cookies and no condiments, not even orange sauce for the spring rolls.

It's definitely a step up from the standard campus eateries, and I applaud their efforts to use locally-soucred, sustainable food.  

The thing that keeps it from scoring higher is the consistency.  The breakfast bagel, for example, hits the full range from 1 to 5 stars depending on the day.

I was disappointed by the chocolate mousse cake duo. The cake was dry and ruined what was an excellent main course experience.

This used to be my favorite bar in the whole city for years.  Then it changed.  Down were the ice skates, down were the random posters everywhere, no more is the pool table, and the upstairs is now a shitty venue.  /sigh

Well the moose used to be great and then they added things like order and second floor band cover charges.  I've maybe seen 2 bands at the moose that didn't make me want to rip my ears off and throw them at the drummer.  Lotsa crappy punk.  Regardless don't discount the moose just because i discredit it.  Its still a rad place for all the tatt'd up heads to hang out at.  Its just not the same.  Regardless they still have slayer on the juke along with down and maiden.  They still have the most insane things on the tv at any given time and the hockey stick banister.  I hope to hell they still have metal mary.  And they still have my memories.  

They used to do vinyl metal night, always a good time.",4620,5

1) 1st time with my mother and wife.  The food was good.  We are all familiar with Ethiopian food.  Maybe the food was a bit Americanized, as we have eaten Ethiopian food elsewhere in the USA.  We got a standard vegetarian combo meal.

2) I have taken a few of my work colleagues to this place, as I work nearby.  They were from Toronto, and others were from Italy.  For having never eaten Ethiopian food before, all were impressed.  They found the food good quality.  One of my colleagues called the food ""yummy"".",2707,5

Lol but anyways so we ordered and so you know old people are slow when making decisions on what to eat or so but she shouldn't be more patient and shouldn't be giving us an attitude. Then we ask her if the food comes with rice blah blah and she said no it doesn't come with a rice so we ordered rice about 6 orders cause some just went to eat soup and when our order came there was about 12 and the ones that we didn't order that she said doesn't come with a rice comes with a very big serving of rice!! I know right what a huge waste!! And so at the very beggining we told her that our checks is separate like for 3 checks. So there was a service fee  too and she expects you to give her huge tip.

The bartender was busy talking to the people sitting at the bar and possibly didn't see the drink ticket?  Our server was nice enough, just not super nice, nor super attentive.

My first time trying the fresh scallop was here at Goyemon. The scallop was so breath-taking that it almost made me want to write a haiku. It was citrusy, fresh, and perfectly textured. 

The non-ice cream desserts here are also arguably the most delicious compared to other sushi restaurants. At least try the crème brûlée and chocolate pudding/soufflé and you'll thank me later.

Exactly when I started to go there often but just for this particular dish I would hear other ppl come in & only order this dish too. THEY HAVE THE BEST PUMPKIN CURRY DISH!

One of my friends asked about the promotions and he replied, "" its over know""after it was in the open in the bar.

I think it is unprofessional when a customer needs to tell you about customer service and educate on how to do there job.

679,3,"We came here on New Years Eve with some old friends - looking forward to some great Italian food. We left a little disappointed.

We started with some appetizers - the calamari was awesome, and the kids liked the mozzarella sticks. The hot antipasti for two was good, with the exception of the mussels (maybe just a preference of mine). We ordered two platters for seven of us and it was more than enough. 
Dinner is where the struggles came.

Special tonight - lobster tail with scallops in a scampi sauce over linguini - who could resist it? We ordered two of them. Also ordered chicken parm, shrimp scampi, osco buco, chicken francaise (not on the menu but they said they make it) and a side of linguini and clams. 

I'll start by saying our food came out before they started clearing our appetizers and salad, and there was stuff everywhere, stacked and ready to tip over. 

The chicken parm did not disappoint, the guys loved it and the portions were very large. And the Osco buco was so tender and flavorful. Really special. 
The lobster tails were so over cooked and tough that we could not get the meat out of the shell. And two of us ordered the same meal, one of us got five scallops and the other one (me) got 3.  We told our waiter  when he came back about the lobster and he said either give me your whole plate and order something else, or keep it. He did say it wasn't him it was his manager, but ""say what""? We said can't we just keep the plate and you bring new lobster tails. He came back and said all he could do was take $10 off each plate. Ok we said. So much for lobster tonight. 
The chicken francaise was COVERED in mushrooms. If you like them, that's awesome. If you don't, and don't expect them, it kind of ruins the meal. When we asked, the waiter said they always serve mushrooms with their francaise (never seen that before but ok) so my daughter took them off. She ordered gnocchi on the side but it was a bit doughy. 
The pizza we ordered for our 3 year old came our about ten minutes after our food, we can only assume the forgot the first time around. 
Drink refills were slow, again I assume because it was busy. 
All in all we will go back, but thought the review was fair.",3959,1

My first ever experience with Dan, those wontons & the moon sauce was around 1am over a year ago walking sloppily through southside (judge me) We ordered seafood wontons and continued on our walk... then turned around and ordered another batch. I've been back quite a few times since then (sober of course). 

My go-to is the chicken shish kabob- which surprisingly isnt served on a stick like a kabob. It's just chicken laid on rice. The chicken has their moon sauce on it (the sauce is great by the way) I've also tried some of my friends general tso's which wasn't bad. You can the general tso's sauce anywhere from mild to blazing. I've also tried bobby's keilbasa kebob which is also delish and i believe it has moon sauce on it as well. We are always sure to add an order on of seafood wontons.

The only issue I have with this place is that it's usually ALWAYS packed in the summer!  But that's because....

Number one:  It's on one of the main streets in Mt. Washington
Number two:  It's a tourist trap
Number three: It's the only ice cream place on the street!  

There you go, no competition!  The owner HAS to make a killing scoopin out the cones in the summer, for sure.

My fav flavor is the Birthday Cake ice cream.  It has cake, frosting and sprinkles mixed in.  YUMMO!  I was not a fan of the chocolate milkshake only because I don't like chocolate ice cream (I know, I'm weird) and they make it with that and choco syrup.  Too much!  If you're looking to go all out, the Brownie Sundae is divine!  

So try to go on the off peak times like....the winter?

This is a casual dining, sports grille kind of place. Both my wife and I had their $17 Burger (we selected chicken burger) and Brew combo with an order of $6 onion rings. Portion size was adequate for dinner. Waiter was attentive even though he was busy he was playful in nature. While we were eating my wife asked me if I thought the chicken burger patty was made fresh or frozen, so we asked. Our waiter with a smile said frozen but followed with the fact that they just hired a new chief and the new chief was appalled at the use of pre-made frozen chicken burgers and assured us fresh chicken burgers will be used in the future. We didn't ask but I highly suspect the onion rings were frozen as well. Somewhat surprising for a place that offers a $777 Kobe Beef and Maine Lobster Burger.

As soon as we got there and told her we had a reservation she was instantly annoyed. I then asked if we could sit outside on this beautiful day and the first table she took us to (past the empty table) had a man already sitting at it, but she still asked if we wanted to sit there still. Then I asked what about the empty table behind us and she said that was for 6 people. I said I wasn't sure how many were coming since I didn't make the reservation so she then asked me to call the person that made it to find out for sure. Finally another employee knocked some sense into her and said we could sit there and the rest of the experience was great!

In the spirit of finding a new brunch service that could exceed or at the very least match tried-and-tested Bouchon, I came across Tableau.  It looks fancy, it's in the fancier, poshier part of the Wynn (if that's even possible!), it's hard enough to find so nobody would just chance upon it, and the glass rotunda in the middle is definitely where the better tables are.  The four of us were lucky enough to get one of them.  

The service was excellent, we never had to ask for the server to top up our coffee and there was never a time that we had to flag down our server.  

The food though, was a bit of a let down.  Maybe I should've tried the orange-infused French toast with honey butter or the eggs benny that a few other yelpers were raving about, instead of the burger, because the burger was, well, ordinary in every way possible.  The hub had an omelet that was too overpowered by onion and the side of bacon was just so so.  

So given the price, I would rather go back to Bouchon for their blueberry friands, sourdough bread, chocolate croissant and pommes frites. http://www.yelp.com/biz/bouchon-las-vegas#hrid:PjzTZX9Il0c4LV-ezt13hA",6607,5

I came in for lunch and I saw that they had a DJ setup so I think they might also have a DJ play during nights. That's pretty cool. The glassware and plate ware are pretty chic. 

Since this place is near Fremont it's a great place to eat and then get some drinks!

Onto the food. I ordered the tonkatsu Ramen and a single salmon handroll. The handroll was 4.75 and I have to say it wasn't worth it. It was the size of an eggroll. And i don't think they used real nori. It was this kind of light green edible paper thing. The roll was good. But I don't think it was worth it because of its size. 

Also I had to wait a long time for our food. However I think this is because they were making a fresh batch of noodles. (The noodles tasted fresh and  I heard they make everything in-house). I also tried some cookies and cream mochi my brother ordered and that was really good.

The service was good. Only problem is that we asked to split the checks and there was some complication so we had to wait longer.  

I think it's still the soft opening so by the time they have their grand opening this place should be poppin! I'm definitely  coming back to try the cocktails.

804,3,Went thursday july 28th around 7 pm and while the food is usually good. The service was super slow. They made tons of food but called no numbers. I think it all goes to take out and uber eats. Which means one is waiting awhile.for the burger. Also the cashier was so unfriendly... no smile did not want to be there at all.. made things awkward. Go there all the time but noticed that service keeps on getting worse,5806,1

Well based upon what myself, my family and friends feel, that people have no other choice at this point, so they just happen to tolerate the bad service and the food; but mark our words, that If and when a new restaurant comes around the corner, guru Lakshmi is just going to drain out in no time.

Well, I order the mac and cheese not knowing it had ham in it. It was soooo good, but I picked out the ham. i also had a beef brisket sandwich, it was huge, good and filling!

I also had to ask her for my bottle of water because when I placed my order, the girl didn't tell me whether I was supposed to get it myself or if she'd bring it to me.  Reguardless, I never got it so I had to ask for it.  I liked my salad.  It was pretty big and I ordered it as a combo with some flatbread, which was edible but nothing amazing.  Would i go back?  Sure, but I may order something different next time and hopefully that same girl that took our order is either trained more or kindly let go.",6927,1

If it weren't such a great coffee shop, I'd never come here again.  I just have to make sure I never come when this girl is working again.  I didn't catch her name because she was too busy telling me to move so she could help the lady behind me because ""she was there first"" even though that's not true...we walked in at the same time and the only reason the lady was first was because she was behind me when we were going into the cafe and I opened the door for her to go in first.  She wasn't even ready to order when the rude barista moved me out of the way to help her, so after an awkward few seconds of trying to get the woman to order, she finally realized she wasn't ready and decided it was time to help me.  When she did so, she tried to explain with an attitude that ""that lady was here first,"" without any apology or even a smile.  If she owns the shop or works here often, I'd never go here again.  She was horrendous and should definitely be fired.",744,1

No onions I hate onions and got them both times.  Slow Down, think about what your doing, and think how the customers feel about being shoved off like that by the employees.

Now that's out the way, I'll try not to let it distract me from writing a subjective review. 

We went during around 5ish, the hipster dinner rush. It was packed, but it shouldn't take 10 minutes to take our drink order and by the time our waitress got around to us, we eagerly gave her our food order. It should be noted that during our wait, the satellite radio antennae was misaligned or something and the music feed was more broken than Cleveland Cavalier fans at the moment. It was pretty annoying. We felt like we were on Mars because no one else seem to notice. Eventually, (20 or so minutes) someone shut it off altogether. Thanks! 

I had the Peppercorn Burger with regular fries.  Yum.  I liked how my hands smelled...sort of like I had cooked a burger over a campfire.  I ordered my burger medium rare and it arrived as ordered, this makes me happy.  The meat was juicy so props to the great sear job by the cook.  So many places screw this up.  The toppings, I'm not sure if the watercress really adds anything other than color and the onion strings, well I guess it's an appearance thing or perhaps texture? Forgettable. 

The fries were ok.  Herb fries translated into minuscule specks of green stuff stuck to the fries with no taste.  They were a little greasy, but I like my fries that way.  My companions ordered the All Nighter breakfast sandwich and the chicken sandwich.  No complaints. 

Ok, back to our waitress with the big fake rack that expects big tips...I was still eating my burger when she decided to give her dessert plug. Really? You couldn't of waited 5 more minutes??? After I inhaled the rest of my burger, we asked her to split the check. She was visibly put off by it and had an attitude about it until we left. 

Shit happens, get over yourself. Unfortunately it carries over to the overall review of the place. Liked the burger, hated the service. So it looks like most of this review was more about the service. What can I say? It got in the way of the most important thing, the food.",57,1

Cons: the Clorox smell in the restaurant is really strong, and having a picture of the world trade centers up in a Mexican restaurant is untasteful. Although most of the food is fresh, the wait time for a small order is really long whether you are inside or through the drive thru.  They are no longer 24hrs so when you randomly get hungry at 3am like me, their extremely convenient location is crossed off the list of possible options of places to go.",4481,5

I wouldn't call Sushi Mon the best sushi place out there but it is certainly top 5 in Las Vegas.  Not only for the quality of food, attention to service, but the hours!  I would hope they have everything I listed above because the prices pinch the wallet.  I don't care too much for special rolls, I've always been the rice on the bottom and fish straight up on top type of person.  And the quality of fish they serve here is fresh and good.  I had one bad experience with their uni but they replaced it with the quickness.

Don't go to China Buffet King expecting the Mandarin, 'cause here they haven't watered down tastes or recipes for the North American palate. If you've ever wanted to try (ecologically unsustainable) shark fin soup, or chicken feet, or *shudder* blood congee, this is the place to have a taste. And you won't need to worry if you hide it under your napkin to be whisked away by the waiter if it makes you queasy. 

The quality of the food is fair to middling. The quantity of the food is epic. Tons of choice here, so if you've got a big group everyone can find something.

Seems clean
Variety abounds

We decided to walk around Little Italy and decided to get dinner here because it's more affordable than some of the other places.  Service was great - the waiter knew the menu items and was honest when he had not tried some of the food.  I enjoyed the bread and the oil or tomato topping that came along with it (I can't remember!).  I ordered the primavera pasta with red sauce.  It was tasty and the portion was HUGE.  I think I got three meals out of that plate.  It just wasn't anything to rave about in my opinion.  I appreciate the family atmosphere and just being in Little Italy.

Food came out fast and furious and our waiter was really nice, especially to my five year old niece.  Was constantly keeping her entertained and gave her a lollipop too.  

As for the food, fried rice with shrimp was huge and amazing and was around $15, but the portion was absolutely huge. Could serve 8-9.  The lobster was not bad, but not amazing.

The rest of the dishes were okay to amazing, but great value at only $6.95/plate.  My favourite was the sweet and sour pork as it was very taste and crispy.  The hot pot was not bad,but the short ribs and bok choy were not the best.

One night while we were eating one of the girls who usually work there came up to us and asked us very rudely if we were almost done yet.

911,3,"I was anticipating an amazing meal however Momofuku didn't quite deliver.

Minimalistic setting and attentive staff. Menu has few offering. Known for their ramen and buns I thought I'd try it myself- after all who doesn't love a bowl of ramen?!

Tried the shiitake buns (hoisin, scallion, cucumber)- bun was incredibly soft and flavourful however the filling was inedible! SALT and lots of it! I found myself eating the bun leaving behind the filling. Disappointing as I love me some mushrooms!

Momofuku ramen (pork belly & shoulder, fish cake, egg)- bowl was flavourful with the egg cooked to perfection. Soup was warm as many diners have complained about. On a cold winter day there is nothing worse than getting any but a hot dish!

Friend ordered the Chilled spicy noodles  (sichuan sausage, black bean, cashew)- amazing! Thought this dish rivalled the Momofuku ramen everyone raves about- definitely underrated! This dish would be perfection in the warmer months! Chilled noodles with subtle heat and the cashews offer the perfect complementary flavours.

Full but not satisfied, my friend and I walked upstairs to the Milk bar for some dessert. A nice touch- the server asked if we wanted something brought down or wanted some time to go up and choose ourselves. Although busy, it was nice to see we weren't being rushed to fill tables.

Milk offerings will curb any sweet craving!!
Get the COMPOST COOKIE!! If there ever was a cookie the Cookie Monster would eat this would be it! As the name indicates- a blend of crazy ingredients one being coffee grinds (subtle trust me) and corn flakes to name a few- all the flavours create this ohh so delicious treat! I wanted to go in and buy the whole place out. Definitely the stand out- not the biggest fan of the other cookies.

Although there is no separate entrance to Milk bar, you are able to walk in and browse through the small refrigerated shop at your own leisure. Trust me, I have made a few trips just for the Compost Cookie alone!

LAVO is a perfect place to pre-party.  We walked in and the restaurant was absolutely beautiful.  We were told to go upstairs and I was surprised to find a really nice club area.  It's small and refreshingly not pretentious, but I can't imagine staying for the whole night.  It isn't a place to go people watch or expect to find the most beautiful people in Vegas, but it's definitely a kick-back place that you can let loose and start the night.

The music was awesome at first and I loved how it was a female DJ spinning.  However, the music got progressively worse and our 11pm-midnight VIP table with open bar expired.  That was our cue to exit and go cause some trouble elsewhere.  ;)

It's better suited for an older crowd in my opinion. I appreciate that there's a vegetarian option on the menu, considering this is predominantly a seafood restaurant. 

We picked Pier W mainly because my boyfriend loves seafood and I'd heard about the all you can eat chocolate dessert buffet that was available though Valentine's Day. In honor of the holiday, they'd dismantled the buffet and plated up some chocolate treats. For $12 a person (with absolutely no sharing according to our server) I expected some of the best dessert of my life. What I got was a plate full of a hodge podge of chocolately things that I didn't really care for. Oh well.

They do Birthday specials here (free for the birthday person if there are 4 more guests?). I recently held a baby shower lunch here and was disappointed about the service. We made a reservation for 1:45pm so we would not be rushed since there are 2 seating (11:30am and 1:45pm). First of all the room was supposed to accommodate up to 25 people. Instead, they used one of the tables outside the room. The manager also said we could stay until 4pm but all of the servers rushed us to get out. I understand the buffet stops at 3:30pm but they could let us just chat at the tables. In the end I found out why because everyone was taking their afternoon naps in between the lunch and dinner service. Anyways, it was horrible and I felt bad for my guests.

I ate a small section of a not-so-awesome blossom recently and my body still hasn't forgiven me.

I was delighted to see they sell truly Briton fares, and I not only have some PT's tips, I also have a new box of Builder's tea to cut my teeth on Monday through Friday to save myself from sad corporate coffee. Builder's is not a pansy tea, no way, this is the stuff of the makings of that enviable strong, upper lip of the quintessential Brit that we Americans somehow lost in our independence. As far as tea goes God Save the Queen, and as far as pastry and coffee goes, long live Rayner's.",1926,1
968,3,"Went here on Thursday, 4/24/14, with my sister's bf Tom T. (He's practically just another sibling to me.)

We missed happy hour by 55 minutes. Agh! The HH and lunch specials looked decent and I may come back to try them but this review is for dinner only.

We were stuck in the back corner by the register. Waitress told us about the menu, how we should order something from each page rather than just order rolls so that we don't end up hungry after an hour. I thought that was super bizarre to mention that their rolls aren't adequate for a meal. 

Tom ordered a bowl of Miso ($2) and gyoza ($5) and we picked three rolls: Spicy Tuna ($6), Spicy Salmon ($6) and Soft Shelled Crab ($9). Our waitress told us that we should really order the spicy soft shelled crab ($14) instead beacuse it was her favorite and the rolls that we ordered we could ""get anywhere."" Again, I found this really off putting and we decided against getting the spicy crab as it was a $5 difference than the roll we ordered.

Miso came out, then gyoza. Do not waste your time on the gyoza. $5 for 5 potstickers that have zero flavor. They might as well be from Costco (but Costco's do have some flavor.) Serious waste of money.

Spicy Salmon and Spicy Tuna were not spicy and without the eel sauce that Tom asked for, were bland. The sushi rice was devoid of any flavor which I also found odd. The soft shelled crab roll was great and I'm glad we tried that one. 

While we were eating, other staff were trying to tidy up around us which was uncomfortable. I don't want people straightening menus at the table I'm seated at while I'm in the middle of eating or sweeping.

Between the two of us, we threw down $15 a piece before tip. Meh, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great either. I'd skip dinner and just check out the lunch in the future.",4095,1

What I love about Boom: 

- Clean! So clean and new looking
- Service! We were seated right away and had attentive but not overbearing 
- Food! Big menus, and delicious food!
- Eggs! They get their own category separate from food because they were AWESOME! Easily the best eggs I have ever had. I'm serious. They have frying eggs down to a science! 

The points that take away from Boom are really small, but so annoying to me that they did affect my experience: 

- Toast! Only one piece of bread?! What's up with that? I need at least two slices! This took away from my egg enjoyment!
- Coffee! Slow on the coffee refills
- Price! a little pricey for what I got, honestly - but if I had got that second piece of toast I would have let it go.... 

SO I will be back, but I'll keep looking for my dream spot!",5734,5

Asked the server about the mole, she said she makes better mole at home (I appreciate her honesty), so I passed on that one and just got a combo platter.  My family order a special and a menu item.

Not bad, not a ton of flavor though.  Didn't have a stomach ache all night or any other issues.  I guess this is my new Mexican place for the time being.

To be fair, I only ever come here for lunch or weekday dinner when it's not filled with drunk Shadyside girls and the ""yinzerita"" crowd (ew). I really like their tofu tacos but they definitely need extra hot sauce poured on for flavor. They give you options between REALLY American (""gringo style"") and Mexican-ish American. They have fantastic drink specials, especially the $2 mimosas on Sunday (however, why on earth does brunch only happen until 1pm?). Prices are lower than Mad Mex and portion sizes are more friendly to non over-eaters. 

Space is huge, including a rooftop deck, and I've never had real problems with the service. Ultimately, Steel Cactus is the kind of place with something for almost everyone, and a good place to bring parents.",6628,5

One thing that I don't like about this restaurant is there are at least 3 waiters hanging around flirting with the customers and yet that one girl is running around taking care of the whole place.

1014,3,"this is a greasy spoon in the truest sense of the word. the portions are huge (kind of enough for two persons) and very greasy and filling, it's hard to finish most of the dishes I've tried. highlights were chicken pho and sweet and sour chicken. prices have gone up like 33% from 2010 to 2016 and there are significantly fewer patrons than there used to be. I went to eat there few days ago around 6pm and a single person was sitting inside, a few more came later on so practically empty.
the waiting staff are revolving door so the service is hit and miss, I can't rate that. some are very attentive, some not at all. anyhow, it's easier to be attentive when there are few people inside than back few yrs ago when it used to be full. I must say that I can't recall we ever waited long on our food. last yrs we came here like once max twice yearly although its on our way every weekend. before that, we used to come every 2-3 months.",5955,1
1015,3,"*Sigh* 

I can hardly believe it, but I finally ate at Pizzeria Bianco, one of America's most famous and highly rated pizzerias. 

After 5 different and failed attempts to try a slice of Oprah's favorite pizza, I contemplated a plan to get in by calling on behalf of a cancer stricken girl with only a month to live and one dream: To eat at Pizzeria Bianco. 

Instead, I took someone's advice and made sure I got there early on a Friday night. And when I say early, I mean not early enough because at 3:45pm, there were already 50 people ahead of me. Estimated wait time? 2 hours!!! And did I mention I got there at 3:45pm and his doors don't even open until 5pm? 

2.5 hours later...to be exact, I was seated. Browsing through the simple menu, I decided to start with the Spiedini. The Italian Fontina cheese wrapped in Prosciutti was a little too rich for me. As for the pizzas-did you catch the plural? I decided to order all 6, yes 6 of the listed pizzas. 

I figured the chances of me waiting another 3 hours to get into Pizzeria Bianco were slim to none so I better order all of them and get it done! Efficiently, with the help of my BF, we finished 4.5 26"" pizzas out of the 6 pizzas in one seating (the Margherita, Marinara, Rosa, Sonny Boy, Biancoverde, and Wise Guy). Told you I could throw down :) The tables beside us were either disgusted or shocked. Out of the 6, my favorite was the Marinara pizza. It stole my heart with its boastful, yet simple flavors of just 3 ingredients-tomato, garlic and oregano. The Rosa was my least favorite because of the overwhelming amount of onions. Being a meat lover, I was disappointed with the protein shakes...I mean pizzas. They were Hoover-daming and drenched with oil. Not sure if they're always like that or if it was just our order? I prefer my pizzas to be moist, not drenched. 

Overall, Pizzeria Bianco has amazing dough and tasty pizzas. I don't think it lives up to its hype taking into consideration the ridiculous wait time and my hunger pangs. But it IS an experience-to be able to try such a famous restaurant located in our own backyard. I'd return...as long as someone else stands in line. I've already taken one for the team.",7515,5

Like all other DQs, this location provides them, so by that fact alone, they make me happy.  However, I don't need a sour-faced 17 year old shoving it at me from the drive-thru window.  Not cool, kid, not cool.  I will take it that said 17 year old was having a bad day, so it's forgiven.

1019,3,"First time enjoying an Izakaya style for a night time snack. We had to climb a few flight of stairs and upon entering someone helped us get seated and they banged on the drum as the workers greeted. We sat right in front of the cooks in their station to see the action, so I thought that was cool.

We started out with their tiger shrimp deep fried with mayo. 6 pcs and it was enjoyable, but definitely would give you a sore throat eating too many of those. Then we got their skewers where you can have 5 different styles. They got pork belly with green onion, beef, chicken, asparagus bacon, king oyster mushroom bacon.

I like to say that the most enjoyable ones were the bacon wrapped stuff and beef. The worst is their pork belly which was really chewy.

We also got their salmon with seaweed in a miso soup style. This to me is just normal, nothing to report about. My gf got the rice with poached egg and pork belly. Again, the pork belly is kind of dry. With just these dishes ordered, BAM $40 +TAX!!! No drinks too. Kind of steep, and I'm not sure if I would enjoy coming back a bit disappointed again. Maybe I'll give Guu a shot since they're top notch Izakaya.",6511,1

36,4,"My wife and I love sushi.  We have been to several Sushi restaurants and sushi buffets in Las Vegas and Henderson.  Personally, I think Sushi Mon is the best - however, it is one of the most expensive.  The only knock on them is:
a.  $27 price tag per head - ouch -- pretty pricey.  Most sushi buffets run around 20-24 bucks.  If you look around, you can get some under 20 too...  If they lower their weekly prices, they probably get more customers. 
b.  1 hour time limit on dinner -- early in the meal, rather than enjoying the meal, I found myself ""clock"" watching.  But, actually, this was not bad, after 45 minutes, I was ready to be rolled out in a wheel barrow.  I was stuffed and felt like I was going to give birth. Being a guy, this probably would be my 15 minutes of fame on CNN.
c.  You may have to wait 20-40 minutes.  By the way, problem with waiting is that there is NO waiting area.  The street is it.  

We have been here 3 times already.  Unfortunately, they do not take reservations.. Be ready to wait in line.  The first time we were here, we had to wait 45 minutes (ended up shopping at Smith's grocery store to past the time).  Secondly, I would recommend asking to be seated at the BAR.  When they seat you at the table, they give you this menu and you have to hail down a waiter.  I rather sit at the bar and watched the ""sushi guys"" make the sushi.  Also, you get quicker service instead of waving down a waiter.  You can ask the sushi guy directly to make you the roll.  As for the sushi, it was fresh!  We love the cooked eel, salmon, and yellowtail.  yum... definitely, we will be back!",8083,2

When we wanted to tell our waiter he was nowhere to be found as it got really busy so we asked another waiter to bring more marinara sauce to make it more juicy.  No luck.  Still dry after adding sauce. Everything was flavored perfectly (not too salty)...just overcooked.  Our waiter when he finally returned (think he's the owner's son) comped the chicken and asked us to come back again for another try.  That was the right thing to do and we will be back.,6482,2
46,4,"I'm really disappointed in Naked City Pizza Shop. How dare they be 20 minutes away? I can only imagine how delicious this pizza must be when it's hot and fresh, and I'll never know unless I eat it there.

Which is never going to happen. Any place with a big banner that says ""Smoker Friendly"" isn't going to be seating my sensitive nose. That's not a criticism: NCPS is inside Moondoggie's bar, so the smoking is reasonable; I get it. But I can't mix the smell of cigarettes with food, so it's my loss. 

NCPS was suggested to my husband here on Yelp when we asked about where to get a pizza that wasn't NY-style or Chicago-style. I love Grimaldi's, and I don't hate Chicago-style, but where ARE all of the ""normal"" takeout/delivery pizzas with a thick crust, evenly spread toppings, and cooked all the way through? (I thought it was Metro. It wasn't. Northside Nathan's is a fave, but it's also a bit far for take-out.)

I'm glad a Groupon came up or we never would've bothered to make the trek to this dive, and I mean ""dive"" in the ""fun, casual, non-derogatory"" sense. Mostly. Even so, we waited until the day the coupon expired. The lure of a potentially good pizza almost didn't beat out location and atmosphere.

I got the ""not-so-wee"" (half-sheet) with mushrooms, ricotta, and garlic. This is a new combination for me and now one I look forward to trying elsewhere. (If I ever find an elsewhere.) I've been eating this pizza for three days now, so believe me that they're honest about the sizes. The ""frickin' huge"" is the next step up and more for dining in with six friends. The step down is the ""wee,"" which I imagine has the benefit of more edge pieces.

Ah, the rectangular pizza and the problem of the edge-less middle pieces. It's one issue that keeps me from getting take-out at Northside Nathan's any more, but NCPS's middle slices were so good that I didn't mind the lack of edge, and a fine edge it is. Chewy, thick, but not hard and kind of fluffy. I could've done with an air bubble or three, but this is good.

My husband got the Stinger without bleu cheese and with ""red sauce"" as opposed to no sauce, I think. (The red sauce has a tiny kick to it - nice.) Let's just say that his didn't last three days.

I was really intrigued by the cherry-chocolate malts, and in just the past few days they've added online ordering, but it's really not a place I want to hang out - not inside, and not in the parking lot, either. For that I have to dock a star. But this is just the kind of pizza I'm looking for... now someone please tell me where to find this in the southwest?",6800,2

The restaurant had a great Naw'leans vibe to it and the outside bistro seating was charming. We started with the Crawpuppies and they were really good but the sauce made the dish. We ordered a pound of crawfish and a fried shrimp po'boy for dinner and was not disappointing. The crawfish was a little too spicy for my taste but they do warn you on the menu. The fiance is from Louisiana so the spicyness was perfect for her. The only reason for the one missing star was the service.

Now, it's been a while since I've had a cow burger, so maybe that's why it was so salivating. Whatever it is, I'm going to go as often as I possibly am able.

I have to say I am very surprised at the negative reviews I have read about the food and service at Lil Baci on Yelp and in particular a recent review indicating that the manager was rude and bossy to staff and phony to patrons. Perhaps the manager or possibly the yelp reviewer, were having a bad day but our experience was completely the opposite.

My husband has a serious food allergy that unfortunately makes us extremely nervous when we choose to dine out. We choose to play it safe and always call new restaurants to establish a comfort level and ensure they can accommodate his needs. I called Lil Baci prior to coming in for brunch and was immediately directed to the manager. She was a very friendly, knowledgeable woman who really took the time to listen to me even though the restaurant was busy. She assured me Lil Baci could accommodate my husband's allergies asked our names and said she looked forward to meeting us. We arrived at the restaurant about an hour later.  After a short wait we were greeted by a woman who turned out to be the manager. When we introduced ourselves, she seated us and really took the time to go over the menu and ensure that we were comfortable with our order. We could not have been happier with the personal touch we received from the manager. She ensured that we will be back!

Now Now.. you know why freshly made Roti tasted so much better... especially when I watching them making right in front of me!! Not doughy at all... and even it was thin, it wrapped and kept the tasty curry goat in place... 

You did not read wrong.. I am eating Curry Goat Roti and definitely enjoying it! Nice and tender hmmm not goaty at all?!! Tasted better than chicken!! I am converted!

Stewed Chicken though on specials was just MEH! When anything that reminds me of my own cooking is MEH!! The chicken reminded me of chickend cooked in soya sauce. 

When the staffs know that we were eating in.. they put the styrofoam in the microwave to heat that up for us! ......hmmmm",5880,2
234,4,"When all is said and done, it's the manager who makes the difference.

We were 9 people out for Happy Hour, just looking to have a good time.  The saga has a pretty happy ending, but for most of the time it was a struggle to get the waiter to attend to us properly.  He was definitely poorly trained, which wouldn't have shocked me if this was Joe's Coffee Shop, but c'mon, it's Wolfie's (no, not the old place in Florida).

He was abrupt, not sticking around long enough to fully explain our orders, giving us a rush job, and generally being inattentive and unfriendly.  A few of us ordered burgers, all cooked medium.  This isn't the waiter's fault (I think), but all of them came out still attached to the cow, dripping blood, which was shocking.  

Enter the manager, Brad Street.  He took charge, making sure we got our burgers replaced and whipping our table into fine shape.  To make up for the rotten service, he comped us some delectable desserts and a few drinks.

Now for the kicker:  We got a single check for the table, which we paid using two different credit cards, one of which was ours.  We asked the waiter to put $120 on our card, which would include our portion of a generous tip.  He returned and said he couldn't do that, because the amount, along with what was being put on the other card, was more than the bill. Strange, but we decided to leave the tip money in cash.

The very next day my husband checked our CC account online and discovered that the waiter had indeed charged our card for the full $120, obviously pocketing the extra, in addition to the cash that was left.  He went right to the restaurant and explained what had happened.  Brad made reparations immediately, and assured us that he would be speaking to the waiter, as well as adding some much-needed training.  

And that's why I've decided to give Wolfgang Puck four stars, bloody burgers notwithstanding.  It's possible it was the chef, but equally possible that the waiter never communicated - or miscommunicated - our requests for edible meat.  We had a good time, the other food was very good, and we'll be returning.",7333,2
243,4,"We went here last week while in Vegas and you cant miss this place.. the outside has the owners face on the front sign.  

We sat down and the waiter took our drink orders and some how he wasnt all there because he was bouncing around like a fish out of water. Guess he was just there for drinks.  He gave my iced tea to my friend, and went to get me another one.. yeah.. I know.  

Waitress came over to order our food and used some little electronic device (pretty cool).  I dont know.. for some reason I got the impression she was a little.. pissy?  She seemed impatient.  Maybe that's just me.

We get the food and guess what.. it was actually pretty good.  I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans.  Pretty simple, but i like simple things. My girlfriend ordered a lemon drop martini with her cheese crisp and hated it I guess.  Cheese crisp was good though.

Funny that I have never heard of the place but then why not as they are new to Az. I haven't seen any ads for the place or places. We came to the store for lunch and I had the brisket with potato salad. I enjoyed the sandwich because it wasn't loaded with sauce as we put what sauce we desire on it after the meat was cut and served. 3 sauces, original, spicy, and sweet. i like the original sauce. The potato salad was better than store bought but my wife makes better than either of those salads.

Hostess and bartender were both super nice, professional, and attentive.  We sat at the bar while we waited for our order, which we took to go.  Wine list was respectable, and they have a decent draft beer selection (a couple of standards, a couple of seasonals, a couple of locals...).

Pizza was outstanding - they have not forgotten their NY roots.  Delicious crust generously topped with pepperoni, onions, and shrooms.  In a word, fuhgedaboutit!

""Small"" Mediterranean salad was really ample, though they could have been a tad more generous with the ingredients that make it Mediterranean.  Tasty dressing, obviously homemade.

I ordered a burger and garlic fries, my husband had the ribs and mac and cheese. My burger was alright, nothing super special and the garlic fries were definitely garlicy, but they were also dry and over cooked making them unpleasant.

My husband gave me a bite of his mac and I was extremely jealous that I did not order it too. Honestly, it is up there with some of the best mac and cheese I've had. I think it would be even better if it had jalapenos in it. So this is my reasoning for giving it 4 stars. because the mac and cheese was awesome! We wanted to come back another night just to have it, but there were too many other options to try out and didn't have time to come back.

Thats what happened when I ordered delivery. I got a call saying no one was answering the door. I said I would buzz them in. ( I was living in an apartment using a landline phone) buzzed the door. Waited. Again a call. Would I come to the door please. Ok so went down no ones there. 
I called the restaurant too see what was wrong. 
They were a house a few streets away. Seems my number was once used there.

318,4,"Yes Tobey, I love this bar also. Probably not as much as you since you're the one making money but whatever, I'll contribute to your wealth as long as I have a good time doing it.

Come here pretty much every time I visit Vegas and stay at Harrah's cause I like the proximity and the atmosphere. Best thing about this bar is the menu: Southern Food.

The menu is varied but I get the same thing almost everytime, a fried bologna sandwich, or as I like to call it: Welfare steak. a big ole slice of bologna with fried onions and cheese on toasted bread. Comes with either fries or tater salad. Where I come from, we put mustard in the tater salad but Tobey don't so I'm not crazy about it. It's ok, just not great.

The wife likes to order side dishes like fried okra, pickles, mac n cheese balls, and meatloaf. This time, along with a couple of sides, she ordered the Chicken n Dumplings soup. First time she ordered this and wasn't crazy about it. She said it didn't have enough dumplings in it.

I have no idea why she ordered this. She makes the best chicken n dumplings I ever tasted which is why I never order any anywhere.

Ok, usual complaint but not really complaining. The price is a little high but remember, this is Vegas 2016. You're not paying $3.99 for prime rib like back in the Rat Pack days. Any other city I would never pay $13 bucks for a bologna sandwich but you're here so don't complain and enjoy.

378,4,"I do not find any significant difference between this location and others (downtown @ Dundas, Scarb @ Midland, Finch-Leslie plaza). Nevertheless, here are the key things to be aware of when considering this branch.

Very convenient location for commuters, just steps away from Finch station. However, street parking only for those coming in cars. Allows use of vicinity rewards card. Limited seating capacity. Expect a line up if visiting from 4pm onwards, especially on the weekends. Washrooms are just ok. ***Accepts cash ONLY for the past few weeks!***",2306,1
407,4,"Atria's is currently running its Oktoberfest promotion, something I wasn't aware of considering this was my first trip to any of its franchises. How ironic is it that my first Atria's experience happened to be at THE first Atria's, the one founded 82 years ago? 

Kay and I have whizzed by what I'll refer to as Atria's Prime far too many times to be forgiven, especially considering that we've resided in its zip code for well over a year. Some weekend errands that took us up and down this South Hills corridor left us with excuses no more. We had to lunch here. 

A chipper lad acted as a valet, parking the Kaymobile safely. I doubt the other chain-ish Atria's offer this, but do not allow it to put you off if you're worried about dining casually at a casual price point. Our t-shirts and jeans were not frowned upon at the least, and my wallet wasn't left gasping when it came time to settle up. 

A hostess led us to an upstairs dining room that overlooked bustling Beverly Road. From the looks of Atria's Prime's exterior and interior, I felt as if I had been invited to a Thanksgiving dinner as the guest of a wealthy relative I didn't know. And in these Victorian-ish environs...I just felt like a burger. In spite of Oktoberfest, and the not entirely common dishes being offered for a limited time,  I required nothing more than a burger. 

Kay's enthusiasm over the special menu did little to dissuade me. Even tasting her splendid Sauerbraten entree, luscious braised beef, doughy, nutty spaetzle, tangy cabbage and all, failed to fill me with envy. 

I was too into that burger, man. 

Every Atria's has one burger on their bill of fare: The Award Winning Cheddar Burger. 

This bull of a burger carries with it no fancy or out-of-the-box accoutrements. Mayonnaise, mustard, coins of sour pickle, shredded lettuce, tomato, and onion are all that come with it, and they are placed neatly UNDERNEATH the cheddar-robed patty (not only does this prevent a mess, but it also keeps the bottom half of the burger bun cool), which in my case was ordered medium-rare, something their chef achieved with the steaming, gushing precision of a champion grillmaster. The bun glistens with butter. The most perfectly actualized housemade potato chips, sliced longways, THE ideal way, come with (or fries or cole slaw if you must...blah) this unassuming masterpiece (I asked for a ramekin of  their fresh buttermilk ranch dressing to dip the chips in and was a very thankful I did so). 

What? They're selling soft pretzel sticks and bratwurst this month and next you're telling me? 

Kay insisted on starting with the salted bread batons, and I thought I was at Olive Garden. Not that I hate the OG or their breadsticks, but they lacked sufficient chew factor to make them memorable. Docile is how I'd describe them. With spaghetti and a salad is the only way I'd have them again. 

The bratwurst was brought to our table on a complimentary basis to commemorate our first visit by the chef himself, his forehead happily beading water like a car's windshield in a rainstorm. That he ran upstairs to give us some of the German sausage in gravy for free and speak with us for a moment was heartwarming. Kay loved the bratwurst. I thought it to be a tad bland and rubbery, but I won't gripe about it much since I felt honored to have sampled it at no cost. 

Hungry minds can be kindred. Hence our simultaneous decision to have the Black Forest Cherry Cake for dessert. Each cornerstone of vicious,delicious, maliciously moist cake was filled with a tart, grisly cherry compote, and iced with a cadaver-white, cocoa shaving-laced buttercream frosting. Chocolate sauce outlined the body, a tuft of maraschino cherry-garnished whipped cream to held off some of the depravity, and a snowfall of powdered sugar to reminded us of dark days to come. A more fitting cake to celebrate the Season of the Witch there isn't. 

To paraphrase the Atria's motto, it ain't bad to eat here.

452,4,"Everyone should go to Binkley's at least one.  You should go at least as much for the experience as you do for the food.  We tried the 4 course tasting menu with wine paring and it was quite enjoyable.  They made a production out of each of the courses as well as when the wine steward presented each of the wines.  In addition to the for courses they presented (served does not seem an appropriate word to use) several interesting small appetizers before and after each of the main courses.  The fine china, the fine crystal, the, the linen napkins, the personalized menus, all made it quite an evening.  As far as the food goes this is a foodies paradise.  The menu is unlike any you will find anywhere else and the way the food was presented was very creative.  It was almost like going to a food art museum.   The main courses looked and tasted great.  I'm glad we did it.  Why only 4 stars you ask?  Because I don't think we will be going back.  I am not the person who watches a show, no matter how great it is, more then once.  When you separate the show from the food you find that the show is what is the most impressive and I have already seen it.  The food and wine alone do not justify the $150 per person it costs and since I have already seen the show it is no longer worth it to me.

It didn't take more than 10 minutes for me to get my food.  Got home, it was still piping hot.  Generous portion of shrimp and TONS of crushed peanuts.  Yummy!

LoL okay. Chips and salsa are my favorite food so that was nice. The guy who took my order....I saw the face you made as you walked away.  -_-

Nachos: Asked chicken or carnitas, he suggested half and half.  Okay. Chicken was delicious, dug out the carnitas after two bites, didn't care for it. Suggestion, don't add the meat, doesn't need it. 

Mexican Corn: Do It!!!!

Mo's dessert: Saved for later and was okay. Mayhap better eaten right away...

474,4,The first time I went here they did not tell me that they added some type of seasoning which is spicy to their food and I almost could not eat what I had purchased. So let me tell you that if you do not like spice then you need to let them know not to added or ask what type of seasoning they use.  The cheesesteak is very good here; I only wish they would use more meat and cheese. I always pay for extra meat but I find that they don't give me extra cheese and I find that my sandwich is dry and for $9.99 my sandwich should not be dry. I recently bought the Gyro and that was not a good experience. It was salty and cut uneven and it just was not good. I will not have that again for me. Also I ordered fries and those were spicy and I was not expecting those to be spicy. So when I do go I order their cheesesteak with no seasoning with extra meat and I am satisfied.

528,4,"The 4 star review is mainly because of the bingo. Me and the gf have always wanted to get drunk and play bingo. It just sounded like a good time. So we looked around and found out the schedules at random places. We decided on palace station because they offer a progressive jackpot that is combined with all the other station casinos and we thought we could hit the oyster bar after. 

5 stars for the bingo - the staff were very friendly and helpful. The lady that we bought our games from was very patient with us and explained everything. We were kinda drunk so I can only imagine how difficult it was. She took her time and made a lot of helpful suggestions. The gf ended up winning twice! You're not going to get rich playing bingo but I was pretty fun. You get two drinks each per session so that probably helped it along. We would definitely come back.

The casino itself is ok. But I mean it's an older casino so you can't expect it to be crazy fancy. You can gamble and you can drink and it's not excessively dirty. What more could you ask for. Don't expect to be taking any scenic pictures. We didn't get to try the oyster bar because of that ridiculous wait. For some reason we figured that maybe the wait wouldn't be bad late at night on Christmas but nope. That thing was as long as ever. There has to be something they can do about that. Maybe expand it? Or anything that would help that. There's no magic in waiting hours to get a seat anywhere. No one enjoys that but that's not the casinos fault so can't really knock them for that.

The patio was rented by some corporate party, so that was closed.  No one would talk to us and the bartender would not even make eye contact. 

I guess we were not hot enough.  


The second time was perfect.  We went in on Friday early 7pm. it was not that busy and we got a table outside.

Being able to order from the lunch menu after 10 pm is a clear selling point for me. $7.50 or less for each dish, plus they give generous sharing sized portions is unheard of and an extreme bargain!

Ok, so maybe we ordered a little too much for the both of us. But, we honestly didn't expect the portions to be so generous! Next time, one item and possibly an appetizer or soup would be more than enough. 

Here's what we ordered:
General Chow's chicken $7.50 (flavor rating 4/5)
Hong Kong style crispy noodles $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Eggplant with garlic sauce pot $7.50 (flavor rating 3/5)
Veggie egg rolls $5.50 (flavor rating 2/5)

Out of everything we ordered, the General Chow's chicken was the most flavorful. The rest of the dishes we're sort of lacking seasoning and flavor.

We did opt for the 5 course and additionally added in the Foie Gras ($15) and the Cheese Plate ($10). We were extremely pleased with our server. We found him to be friendly, attentive and very knowledgeable. The food was excellent and I loved not knowing what might come out next. The one flat and disappointing dish was the Escargot Empinada. The filling was too over whelming for the delicate escargot. All I got was...maybe, lemon zest - not exactly sure. I did enjoy the experience and would return. My only concern was we opted for the 5 course instead of the 4 so that was and additional $10 then from there we also chose the Cheese and Foie Gras as I indicated above. But we still got 5 courses, so in-essence the cheese cost $20 and the Foie cost $35...that is rather excessive and I thought that these would be in addition to the 5th course....

Yes, you don't walk directly into the bathroom, but when you are sitting anywhere near the open doorways, which lead to a tiled ""bathroom looking"" area, it can be enough to turn your stomach.

Turned out it's a little better ? Maybe they finally caught on Yelp ? Who knows, just maintain a good service and your sales will increase.",3341,2
586,4,"My husband and I had been to the location in Scottsdale, and were so excited when we saw they were opening one in our neighborhood! The food is great, you can't go wrong. We love the burgers, aps, salads, the mac & cheese is amazing, and we recently tried the hot dogs which were excellent as well. They have a great selection of beer, wine and cocktails. I especially like their Moscow Mule. They have the food/drink/ambiance thing down (love me an open air restaurant), however, being a new location there are noticeably issues with the service. We have been a few times already, and each time the servers themselves are pleasant, however, the service is very slow. Really in every sense, and the kitchen is extra slow.  Also, having been in the business for many years, it irks me when servers do not pick dirty plates before they bring the check, and that has happened each time we have been there. Its not hard--everything off the table that's not being used, offer dessert and/ more drinks, then check. Not here is you check but let me know if you need anything else, and have fun sitting with dirty plates. Hopefully they can get the kinks worked out soon because this is not an issue in Scottsdale, so you know they know how to do it right. I have faith!",465,2
618,4,"So I went back to Bac (surely I didn't make that up).  We sat outside at the end of the night.  We had great service.  We talked to the server/manager.  We even admitted to writing a one-star review.  We talked about it.  The food was delicious and completely contradicted my experience below.

We will go bac, that is for sure.  Tremont needs more food like this price point and style.


My original one-star review:

So we are sitting at Minh Ahn Vietnamese restaurant on Detroit. ""Why?"" you ask.  We had reservations at Bac for 8:30.  We waited and waited after we were seated at a table at Bac. The hostess lit the candle. We waited. 6 minutes went by. Maybe 10. We noticed no one came. No water, no nothing. Other people were seated, tables were cleared  We waited 6 more minutes. 12-16 minutes solid without contact. We left. You should too. Caveat Emptor.",5520,1
621,4,"We have an oversea visitor who comes almost once a month. And back by popular demands of the family, we always got to Omei monthly with a party of 9+ people.  I have lost count of how many giant Alaskan King crab and arms length lobsters we have ever have, BUT ... We have never been disappointed.  The carbs and lobsters are usually presented (still alive) before it goes back to the kitchen.  Truthfully, I feel very much sorry for them. They usually face each other and probably saying ""Dude ... We are so screwed"" (assuming they speak the same language).  After a stunting brief moment they turn into 2-5 variation dishes.  Steamed legs with garlic with vermicelli and green onions, deep fried with garlic and pepper, soup with garlic and etc, steam/fried omelet with garlic, and last but not least, fried rice / noodles with garlic. Yessss usually those two suckers is spread across 5 dishes and yessss with stinky garlic.  Although presentation isn't like the ones you see from other places ... Ya know, one lobster piece stacked on top of each other that everyone and their auntie has it on their Facebook (wait, why do you have your aunt as friends on FB????) nevertheless, it's still very consistency tasty and obviously fresh! (One reason why they present then alive before hand - yes, me don't like :()  the dishes here are extremely authentic.  Prices is ... You know it. Not cheap :) but paying cash will let you save the taxes loll.  The only compliant is that it's a bit dirty by the kitchen, main walk ways, the bar (no one use it), and definitely the kitchen. Sauces, greasy sauces or spilled everywhere and when you are walking into the washroom you'll need to hold onto dear life or else you'll fall face down onto the ground. Just a hint :) oh btw - never gotten sick from this restaurants so it's nice to know the food is clean ;)  

Highlight of the visit:
Quick turn around and food deliveries.  Desserts that for some reasons can last weeks after fridge'ing it at home.

Food (Taste): 5/5
Food (Presentation): 4/5
Kitchen (Delivery Speed): 5/5
Service: 5/5 - probably cuz we pay big bucks
Ambiance: 2/5 - dirty washroom. #1 or 2 before your meal :)
Fun Factor: 4/5 - they let you take pictures and hold the food before cooking them lol",6961,1
624,4,"Hmm, lil miss virgin & just not seeing the hype. VERY good, but not all excited like most reviews.  Disclaimer, was late saturday, so maybe it wasn't 1000% like normal.  Of course out of both ribs that I was anxious to try, but no worry.  Got a sample of turkey, was AMAZING, ended up getting a lil bit.  

Now... the brisket.  Was ok... didn't wet my pants or anything else like most people gush on here.  Maybe my expectations were super high from all the reviews, but didn't taste the hype.  Don't get me wrong, it was VERY good, but I put it in par with Rudy's (which I think is good).  Now... I had a dry part of the brisket & I prefer a lil fat/juice/flavor, so maybe that's where I'm not seeing it.  Not a bbq crazy, just love good smoke.  Would definitely return, but sorry, wouldn't wait an hour or two in august!",5571,2
644,4,"I have no idea who runs this place, but I've never been disappointed.

I used to work in the Galleria Corporate Center, and would come downstairs to visit Conmigo from time to time. 

The smoothies are tasty. Not necessarily the healthiest. I feel like they are packed with sugar.

The salads are nice. When you ask for the dressing on the side, they happily oblige. The chicken is moist, and juicy. Like a nice....piece of chicken.

My only gripe...is the service can be a touch slow. I didn't knock them down any stars for this because it's not their fault for being understaffed. There needs to be another Conmigo in the building. 

All in all....good times, good food.",1419,2
649,4,"A friend raved about this restaurant and wanted to go as she has recently adopted a vegan diet. This restaurant seems to serve some very healthy, fresh food. We were asked if we had any dietary restrictions (e.g., wheat). (No, for me.)

I was pleasantly surprised by the healthy protein burger - nothing like a burger, really, which was just fine as it tasted quite good. (I was a little worried as I like In 'n Out burgers ---but again --this was nothing like a burger ---no need for ketchup or mustard.) Healthy protein burger ingredients: chickpea, red beans, sweet potato, walnuts, chia seed, spaghetti squash, parsley, spinach, and kale and topped with slices of cucumbers and pesto. I skipped the bun. 

For the side dish, I chose the sweet potato and avocado salad with Asian dressing. It was good, too. I was disappointed by a rather bland iced tea of the day - orange ginger. It did not have ginger nor orange flavor and reminded me of Korean barley water, although not quite as good.

My companion also had the healthy protein burger, but chose a side of sweet potato fries, which were quite tasty. 

Our waitress was attentive in the beginning, but seemed preoccupied with paperwork at the end of our meal. She came back and asked how our meal tasted (great! --appreciated the taste of the meal and the check-in). After the meal, we ordered the iced tea. She did not return after dropping that off except to leave the check. We went up to the front to pay after waiting for quite a time with no one returning to the dining room (we were ready to leave just after 2 p.m.) At the register, I asked her what the ingredients were in the ginger orange tea, and she said she would find out. She asked another person beside her, did not say anything to me and then walked a couple feet away and started working on papers. I waited a few minutes (I was standing there at the counter doing nothing) and asked again. She said, oh, I thought she (the other person) was going to find out. She seemed a bit irritated (strange considering this restaurant is supposed to cater to folks that are particular about ingredients in their food), and went into the kitchen. She came out and told me: green tea, orange and ginger. (Maybe I was served the wrong tea, but it had zero ginger zip and no orange flavor...I don't recommend that tea...)",7168,2
665,4,"The food here is amazing! My friends and I, who all lived in Tokyo for a time, met up here for a reunion. We ordered the set menu for $25/person and found it was a great amount of food! They have beers as big as your head! and the cocktails are good if you aren't a beer person. The sexy geisha drink was a table fav! It's a really loud and lively environment so like the other reviews said, don't go if you want to have a quiet conversation or if anyone in your group is hearing impaired. We ended up getting a table on the heated outdoor patio section which worked out really well for our group. It was warm and cosy but it worked!

My only complaint is the server we had at our table. He wasn't personable at all and seemed very keen to get us to leave. He gave us our ""30 minutes left and no more ordering"" talk around 40 minutes before our 2 hours were up and refused to bring my friend a drink when there was still plenty of time left. Then he came and told us that people were waiting for our table. When we told him we still have 10 minutes left he wasn't apologetic at all and was generally a very unpleasant individual. Everyone else working there seemed great so hopefully this person won't be working the next time I go!",4798,2
667,4,"I go here because they offer a gluten free crust and vegan cheese. I usually get the arugula and pear Pizza, as well as the quinoa salad.  Both are delicious. I am subtracting one star because their servers don't always know what Vegan means. Also, the water they serve is absolutely disgusting. I've never tasted anything quite as bad. They say it goes thru a filter but I don't know. It seems so dirty.",5072,1
687,4,"I am somewhat conflicted by Monteray Bay. I want to absolutely love this place, but i honestly can't. 
  My wife and i went there recently celebrating our anniversary. It was a pretty big deal to us. When i made the reservation i noted this and hoped to get a window table. I purposely made the reservation slightly off peak. When we arrived, on time, we had to wait almost 15 minutes to be seated. I was disappointed in the seats we were given. I asked politely if there was a chance we could be seated by a window, and was told that would require at least an hour wait. We sat in such a way that my wife had a decent view. I had virtually no view unless a turned almost sideways.
   Oh well, this happens, and i wasn't going to allow it to taint our celebration. Our server greeted us and reviewed some of their specials, bit dinner and appetizer.  They suggested a combo appetizer that had a small crab cake, 2 shrimp, and a skewer with several small pieces of Tuna and Salmon on it. That sounded like a nice light appetizer to share, so we ordered it. We got our drinks and perused the menu. 
   Obviously their focus is on seafood, and they offered a nice selection on their menu. While we were trying to decide, one of the managers came to our table and greeted us. He wished us a happy anniversary(nice touch), and when my wife asked for some input on her choice, he suggested a particular fish. She decided to order what he suggested.
   We received our appetizer, and it was indeed small. Just enough to take the edge off, and very very tasty. My wife wanted to taste their lobster bisque, but didn't want too much food before the entree, so we agreed to share a bowl. The server actually brought it to us already divided into two separate portions(another nice touch). Awesome. It wasn;t quite as good as a local restaurant that we visit, but it was certainly good. 
   The server had taken our order and we were relaxing and talking and enjoying the night.  Then, the server came to our table and informed my wife that her fish choice was not available. Seriously? The recommendation of the manager was not available? Not cool. SHe made another choice and kept her fingers crossed.
   The entrees actually came out pretty quickly. We had ordered a few side dishes since everything there is ala carte.  The food was delicious. The vegetables were cooked perfectly, and everything was very flavorful. We enjoyed our dinners.
   We had a second round of drinks and finished our dinners. The server informed us that since it was our anniversary, if we wished to share a dessert it would be com0plimentary (yet another nice touch). We have the angelfood cake cheese sandwich which was unique and quite good.
   All in all, it was a very nice dining experience and we enjoyed it. So why not 5 stars? Nothing huge, just some small things that added up.
   First of all, i am no stranger to fine dining, and to the cost of fine dining. That said, Monteray bay crosses the line into slightly overpriced. That little appetizer was $27 (had no idea when we ordered it) The Lobster bisque(which had a few small langostinos) was $15. They charged us $7 for water. 
  With all of the competition for fine dining dollars in the area, i think they may be in trouble down the road if they are not careful. From everything i have read and heard, Altius offers a superior dining experience for around the same money. There are other choices too. certainly MB offers a great dining experience, but I am not it is quite worth the check at the end of the night.",6986,2

741,4,"Have heard much about the DCP but until today have not have a chance to visit. When we saw an event that supported small businesses within the park, we made it a point to visit. The GF and I rolled in via Uber and were dropped off at the praying mantis.  We stopped by the yelp desk and I was tickled pink to finally meet Norm K. & Nate M.  After exchanging pleasantries the GF and I were off to explore.

It is absolutely what one can do now a days with a freaking storage container.  I had marveled at the miscellaneous websites I have visited looking at cabin designs using with prefab material.  DCP is no exception. I likened it to a circular, multi-layered fort in the middle of downtown Vegas.  The centerpiece of DCP is a play land for kids that made me want to be eight again.  If it would not have been creepy or I would have ran the risk of getting stuck in some contraption, I would have bounced all over this steel, kiddy wonderland.

There was lot's to do and see.  We saw everything from hotdogs, booze, chocolate, glass, booze, booze, jerky, and an art gallery.  I hope to write reviews on many of shops we stopped in and spent money.

What makes this novel location a four star instead of a five is the tight quarters and a closed rest room.  Depending on where and when you visit, the potential for someone to touch you and breath on you is great.  For the most part everyone was cool, but you do have your selfish idiots out there.

As for the rest room, I stood outside one for almost 10 minutes.  I did not know the layout inside and assumed it could have been meant for a single individual.  Two employees would eventually exit and tell me the restroom was closed.  I told them it would have been helpful if there was a sign.  One of them told the other there should have have been a sign outside.  Whatever.

All in all, the environment and atmosphere is hip.  The businesses are for the most part...friendly.  I did not see you vagrant or doper.  Thank you to the ranger's who are manning the entrances.  

We look forward to checking out the DCP again!",7683,1
766,4,"Call me crazy but when I see a place like this (one that I personally enjoy) with such mediocre reviews I wonder 'What's wrong with everyone?'. I have a policy at home that a restaurant with less than 4 stars should be bypassed or reserved for a day you wont be upset at a 'waste'. I take my food very seriously. So I ventured a little more in to the review section here to see what brought the marks down on this place, and here it is:

1) Price: Yes, it's expensive. Even I feel, at times, it's expensive to an unreasonable degree. It's casual atmosphere, service style, and location doesn't account for the price tag...but then I remember: This is alternative food. There are unique, healthy, exotic and unheard of, things on this menu. This cost money. Quality cost money. If you are a first timer to the health craze, 'detox' community the menu is confusing and unwarranted. Which brings me to my next point. 

2) Intimidation: A ton of low marks came from sheer cluelessness. I won't berate the point, but this is obnoxious. I compare this to visiting a restaurant that serves offal and complaining about all the calf brains on the menu. Newbies, should take this restaurant as a learning experience and not a let down, that someone didn't just throw clique poutine on their plate. 

3) Health Factor: A continuation of the above is the fact that people want poutine. 'These cheese curds didn't taste like cheese curds'. Well, of course they didn't. It's not cheese. Please oh please do not be surprised when things don't taste exactly as you want when this particular thing is not made with any of the same ingredients. If that is too harsh, don't eat here. These alternative foods are tasty, for what they are. The reviewers should know this, and review in context. I'll repeat: Burgers don't taste like burgers, and tacos don't taste like tacos. But Fresh's VERSION of these things is damn good. Please see: Quinoa Onion Rings. 

4) Size and Service: It's beyond me how the same reviewers mentioned (too) large of portions and in the same breath the high price. Second with this complaint is service. A word to the wise, although prices are steep, this isn't fine dining. It's a cafe. Loud, bustling, and semi obnoxious. Know that.

All in all Fresh isn't the most amazing place I've ever been, but it's one of the best doing what they do. And within the context of it all, deserves a little more than three stars.",3169,2
767,4,"This was our second time coming here for breakfast and like the last time, we enjoyed it! We stay at the Trump hotel and this seems like the closest diner. Just a 4 minute walk up Bay and then Richmond. The atmosphere is nice for a diner -sunny and airy feeling with plenty of table space. Chocolate chip pancakes are great! And I love that when I order the toast, it doesn't come smothered in butter. The breakfast potatoes are nice, too. Not too greasy and not too heavily flavored -they border on being bland. Eggs are the worst here, though, unfortunately. They are very small and not cooked enough, even for over easy. They often seem watery and way too runny -almost seem like they're not cooked enough, safety-wise. Coffee is also not that great, here. We often stop at a Starbucks/Timmy's on the way here. Will probably keep coming back though as long as we stay nearby! Convenient, good service and decent breakfast food!",5707,2
777,4,"Not the fanciest looking place. Not by a long shot. Heck, this might even have a ways to go to be one of the worst looking places. But don't let that fool you - if you can find your way there (go to the light past the Hardee's, around the bend and back again), park where you can, and pull up a seat.

There is no tender loving care here. While the staff gets things done, they do not take the time to coddle you, because it's fast and furious like Vin Diesel is coming to town. There is no time for that sort of thing, since they are all business here. That does not mean they are not friendly, just that you may be disappointed if you want to be treated gently is all.

If you're up for a mild adventure, however, this is the place to be - the after those servers come at you, the food is not far behind, and it is generally excellent. To make things even better, it's not pricey. On Sundays you can even get their lunch fajitas for just five bucks. Yep, five bucks. Nice. Just make sure you arrive early, because despite looking like a hole in the wall, and being a slight challenge to find, this place gets busy at times.",4481,1

La decoración esta super original y desde que cruzas la puerta, te reciben las Enfermeras-Meseras listas para ponerte tu bata de hospital. El lugar es bastante grande y la idea del negocio es que sus productos te pueden provocar un ataque al corazón por el exceso de calorías. Por ejemplo, las malteadas las sirven con un pedacito de mantequilla, eso no lo había visto en ningún lado. Las hamburguesas aunque sin duda no fueron las mejores hamburguesas de mi vida, si tienen un sabor especial y muchas calorías. 

Lo único que no me gusto es que, no te permiten compartir las mega hamburguesas, entonces cada quien tiene que ordenar la propia. Nosotros íbamos con la idea de comprar la mega hamburguesa como con 5 carnes pero para compartirla con toda la familia y no se pudo por que ""no se pueden compartir"". 
Lo gracioso del negocio es que la gente que no se termina la hamburguesa gigante puede ser golpeada por las enfermeras en el trasero :O. Y claro que todo el establecimiento se llena de carcajadas.

The big surprise was the complete organization and professionalism of this establishment!  Despite the throngs of customers, all hyped up for the game, the service and food were excellent.  We had to carb load to have energy for the game (ha!) so indulged in the gargantuan Chicken Nachos and the Sliders and Fries.  Our fries were lukewarm-but our server Christian immediately came back from the kitchen with crispy hot fries, before we could blink our eyes.  He was calm, cool and collected amidst all of the gazillion customers.  My only suggestion regarding the food is to season the chicken in the nachos.  It appeared to be steamed and unadorned.  Also serve with a side of salsa.  I sought out a Manager to compliment the restaurant on its efficient handling of the customers during a busy time.

Got take out from here this weekend. We ordered two dishes and had a group so pretty good value. Now this rating was hard to exude because one dish was outstanding!! The other was bland and boring beyond words. I ordered the lamb meatballs tangene and the boy got apricot chicken. 

The meatballs were seriously phenomenal!!! The chicken was bland, barely any chicken or veggies and in a sea of couscous that wasn't very flavorful either. I'm still giving this place a four because I literally put the meatball in my mouth and declared it the best thing iv eaten this year!

868,4,"I am a regular here so let's get that bias out of the way. Here are a few tips to help manage expectations:

- call ahead and put your name in the que it will save you from a super long wait when you get there. Make no mistake though, you will likely have to wait 10-15 mins at a minimum. They only have about 4 large tables to accomoddate groups larger than 6.

-they have English language menus, just ask

-skip the shrimp and pork shui mai, I find the ""skin""/exterior too thick on this in comparison to the rest of their offerings

-80% of dishes have pork or meat, like most Chinese restaurants...so don't complain about it being skewed in the carnivore favour

-fried onion cake, steamed dumplings with ""soup"" and Pot stickers are staples here and a must try

Like most Chinese places the service here is not a priority. They will get you what you need but will likely not follow up or try and make small talk. They will expect you to get up and leave shortly after your food is finished. If you want a refill on your thermal tea pot, just open the lid and leave the pot at the edge of the table.",6052,1

897,4,Moved here recently from Chicago but originally from NC.  Never had Jets before but had some friends mention it and then received a Groupon.

898,4,"I ate here for brunch on Sunday. The wait wasn't short (around 45 mins) but if you've ever been to Boiling Crab, you won't worry about the line.

$25 for regular brunch/lunch or $30 to add champagne, which isn't bad at all.

I wouldn't recommend eating any carbs here - french toast, waffles, bread, cheese blintz etc. No, not even the banana stuffed french toast. They're all so meh - like i'm sure you could make better ones yourself. The custom omelets were fine but they definitely overdo the cheese. Skip the breakfast sausage - they look delectable but they're so tough and very dry (sad panda). Regular bacon was solid though.

Definitely go for the fish (Bluenose and Salmon) and any of the hand-carved meats (Prime Rib, Hand-Carved Bacon). Don't bother with the Green Curry Duck, though - looks disgusting and no taste whatsoever. Breakfast sausage was terrible and dry. The spicy tuna hand rolls were tasty. Desserts are typical buffet quality with the chocolate eclair being the standout.

Couldn't tell you about the salad - that's what we Asians call, ""a waste of money and stomach space."" if you're going to a buffet, keep your eye on the prize, don't 'rest your stomach' for too long and hold your bread, rice and pasta until the end.

After a wait of around ten fifteen minutes we made it to the promised land!  Unlike Spice Market (once upon a time a Vegas fave of ours), just about all the food looked quite appealing!  How can eggs Benedict from a buffet be so darned good?!  I'm a massive fan of breakfast food, and nothing I had was disappointing.  Wife loves her fruit, and was especially pleased by the watermelon.  It was one of those experiences where you almost wish you were back in Roman orgy days (oops... wrong casino!) so you could go to the vomitorium and then come back for more delectibles!!!  I'm oh so close to giving the buffet 5 stars, but drop one as a result of mediocre coffee, the lack of personalized stations other than for omellettes, and too many limp and rubbery-looking pieces of bacon to wade through to find some crispier gems.

1024,4,"I'ld give 6 stars if possible for each and every appetizer we have had. The tomato soup, caesar salad, beignets, and crab dip are all way more delicious than they have any right to be. However, the stand out is clearly the shrimp canapé - one of the best  appetizers I've ever had. Period. 

The other side of the coin is the at-best mediocre entrees. The first night we had a gift certificate and ordered an absurd amount of food and ended up leaving both the burger and meatloaf largely untouched. On subsequent visits the appetizers were consistently amazing and the variety of entrees just didn't live up to the apps. The blackened tacos were bland and tasteless. The meatloaf was swimming in liquid. The burger bun was overly toothsome and the burger bland. 

Long story short - order appetizers (which there are more than enough of) and you will be happy. Also happy hour is great but the wine is overpriced otherwise. 

Take away = worth it for shrimp canapé if nothing else!",5852,2
33,5,"The only thing I can rate is the frozen custard.. I don't know anything about the other food they serve here.  It started with one scoop of vanilla custard in a dish everyday for a week.  Then, I started to crave it more and got 2 scoops... this stuff is so tasty.  I like vanilla better than chocolate and I am not interested in the flavor of the day.  I have been trying to ""break the habit"" of eating this stuff so finally one day I asked for a nutrition guide... turns out 1 scoop of this bliss has 308 calories (more than haagen daas).. so 2 scoops is equivalent to a one hour run... just to put it in perspective.. If you don't care about calories, this  stuff is sweet bliss in a dish!!!",1715,1

The prices range from $2.99 to $12.99 from an appetizer to a dinner plate...unless you're getting that boat with food that'll feed an entire village it will run you $65 bucks. that's like $6.50 for 10 people...not bad at all!,6149,1
41,5,"I used to work at Palazzo and went to Grand Lux cafe a lot.  I recently went there and was once again blown away by the consistently good food and service.   I usually sit at the bar and have always had great meals there.  

It's strange though, the Grand Lux at The Venetian, which is open 24 hours a day, isn't even close to as good.  I can't figure out why.  Maybe the 24 hour operation drains the spirit out of the workers.  Who knows.

At the Palazzo location, however, If you get the Linguine with Clams and pay an extra three bucks for the shrimp you have a $19.95 plate of pasta that is downright awesome.

The Corn Beef Hash and a Sam Adams is the time tested and purest way to kick any of the previous nights activities out of the loop and make you feel like sunshine.

They've got some version of the Molten Chocolate Cake that is grand.  It's take 20 minutes so be aware.

One word to the wise, their dishwasher leaves some kind of film that affects the taste of the draft beer.  The bartenders are aware of it and try to rinse the glasses before serving, but it slips their mind sometimes.

Other than that, I have nothing but good things to say about this location of Grand Lux.",2999,3
54,5,"Back at Christmas I can in to this location during a particularly busy time, and had to wait a while behind a large order. No big deal right? I didn't think so, shiz happens, I'm not gonna get all butt-hurt cuz I hadta wait a few minutes. At any rate, the cashier apologized and have me a little business card with a coupon to come back later and ""buy one burrito, get one free""

Fast forward to today, I decide I'm gonna get me a burrito, and stop in at this location. Now, I knew that my coupon had expired, but I thought wth, might as well give it a try. I asked the manager, shift lead, whatever, if I can still use the coup and says ""sorry sir (yes...he called me ""sir"") this has been expired for months"" I tell him no problem, and order my food. When I go to pay for my burrito, the guy tells me ""you know what, don't worry about it, you got that coupon because we messed up last time, I'm not gonna charge you...AND imunna comp your drink too""

I really am not so shocked though. This place is so consistent. Enough talk about how one pizza place taste like New York. Really, stop it! I am from Brooklyn, NY and there is NO pizza in Arizona that comes close to tasting like New York pizza does. That is not a bad thing either. I'll tell you why. There is not a pizza joint in New York that tastes anything like a Red Devil Pizza. We truly are blessed to have pizza this good and unique in Arizona. Now, it has taken 50 years to open only 5 stores. I think the Bistro is the newest location. Whatever they want to call it is fine, it is still a Red Devil.",5085,2

122,5,"This is AMAZING!! Went to Vegas weekend before last and purchased this at 11:30am at the Paris brunch. That was probably the best meal, though I keep going back and forth in my head between there and the Carnival World(Rio) dinner. Besides those 2, we also went to Flavor's(Harrah's) for what was supposed to have been a snack(okay, maybe a little gluttony in order to maximize the use of our 24 hour pass) but turned into 2 plates. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Then the next morning on our way out, we hit Spice Market(Planet Hollywood) for breakfast/brunch. You can skip that one. I wished we did and went to Rio instead, but unfortunately I let my curiosity get the best of me because I had never been there before. We didn't make it to the others(missing the Imperial Palace was intentional), but 3 of the 4 we did hit were great. I'll also review each one in detail separately, so feel free to read those if interested. Overall this is a great deal and I think you should get it!!",1644,3
132,5,"We were headed to Robin Square, but unfortunately they were closed.  Wandering around, we saw Mondavie.  Friendly greeting when we walked in.  Lorenzo is crazy funny!  We decided to sit at the bar, and he told me that if anyone came in, I was suppose to seat them if he wasn't up there.  I felt at home.  The bartender, Kim, was friendly and funny as well!  We all felt at home. 

I ordered the poutine with braised lamb.  This tasted more like the traditional, however, that first one in Vancouver will forever be my favorite!  Two of us ordered the lamb chops since that is the house specialty.  The others had the steak frites.  The chops were grilled perfectly!  They came with some assorted vegetables and a rosemary marinade.  The others said the steak was ok, nothing spectacular.  I'm of the opinion that the lamb is the way to go!

Our bottle of Malbec didn't last very long, so we though another was in order.  It was fun sitting at the bar and watching all the guests coming and going.  We started making up stories as we watched, like the couple on the first date and her thinking, ""How do I get out of this?"" and him thinking, ""She's the one!""...things like that.  They also have live jazz playing which is nice, especially if you are in the main dining room.

Again, Lorenzo and Kim made the visit so much fun and enjoyable.  I would definitely come back if ever in the area!",3485,2
146,5,"Ok, as you are reading this, there is Hawaiian music playing in the background.

Now picture yourself at a luau on a beach in Hawaii. Hula dancers shaking their hips. Dudes spinning their fire pole thingy. Ha ha, that's a nice visual. Anyways, all you did was walk into a Braddah's Island Style restaurant. Ok, you can stop the music now. Actually when you go there they really do play Hawaiian music. 

When you come here, your options are simple with 5 easy steps. 

STEP 1. You pick whether you want a Burrito (flour or wheat tortilla), Bowl (bed of seaweed rice), Salad (bed of romaine lettuce), 3 Tacos (soft flour or crispy corn). 

STEP 2. Pick your meats. Huli Huli Chicken, Kalua Pig, Pulehu Steak, Grilled Fish, or just Grilled Veggies. 

STEP 3. Pick your toppings. Seaweed Rice, Black Beans, Shredded Cabbage, Romaine Lettuce, and Grilled Veggies (for a charge).

STEP 4. Pick your salsa. Charred Pineapple Verde (mild), Mango and Roasted Corn (medium), Tomato with grilled Maui Onion (spicy).

STEP 5. Pick even more toppings. Sour Cream, Cheese, Lettuce, Jalapenos, Cabbage, Lime, and Guacomole (for an extra charge).

Of course you can put any or all of the toppings on to your entrée selection. I can also describe how all this tastes, but that just wont do it justice. You need to come here and sample their product, which they will happily give to you.

Last but not least, finish it off with Coconut Bark. A salty and sweet concoction that will make your sweet tooth want to jump out of your mouth and make a residence here. This is their only dessert option but honestly, that's all you need.

Chris, the owner who was just behind the counter helping make orders, was also walking around bussing tables and talking to every customer that was there making sure everything was ok. When he came up to me, I had all sorts of questions for him and to my surprise, he answered every one of them sincerely. Things like more promotional menu items like Shrimp and Kalbi Ribs for starters. I was impressed by his honest response to any and all criticism that I had. That's the type of owner I like. One who listens to their customers and takes things to heart. Now if this is how the owner acts, I can only assume all his employees will have the same positive attitude.

Some random info. At the time of this review there is a 20 dollar for 10 Groupon so take full advantage. They have free wifi and the code is on the wall above you when you come in. On Sundays, if you come wearing sandals or flip flops, you get free chips and salsa with your order. They take cards. Their dining room is spacious and equipped with napkins and some kind of good tasting Hawaiin sauce. They have two separate solo bathrooms for men and women.  And lastly, they have a drive thru!

So a big mahalo to Chris and his staff. You just got yourself a customer for life!",2718,2
178,5,"Gonna keep this one short and simple. Everyone knows how Subway works.

But I LOVE this location because.....

1. It's 24 hours.
2. Service has always been great here. They're not rude and always greet and acknowledge their customers whenever someone walks in the door. Even if they're busy.
3. SOUPS!!!!! THIS LOCATION HAVE SOUP!!!!! I've tried both their chicken noodle and broccoli cheddar soup and they're delicious!!! Perfect for those sick days or cold chilly days. (I've been to at least 2 other Subways around the area and other locations do not have soup. What's up with that yo!?)",7487,1
180,5,"We had been looking forward to trying out a good Mexican place in town. When I saw the Groupon a few days ago for Monterrey I picked it up and we went there tonight to use it.

The restaurant is tucked away in the back of the Magnolia Plaza. It has quite a few seats in it, and when we went in at 6pm there were only two other tables there. There was a friendly hostess waiting as we entered, a guy brought over chips and two salsas (one mild and very tomato-y and the other having some spiciness) the moment we were sat down, and the waitress came over within a minute to greet us and take our drinks down. The drinks are one of the reasons this place gets 5 stars in my book. I had a 16oz glass of XX on tap, and it was only $2.85! My wife had the house margarita which was 12oz and that cost only $1.99. These are their everyday prices! Not happy hour, not the Monday special, but every freaking day of the week!!!

The menu is what I like to see in a Mexican restaurant...a variety of special entrees as well as the ""combination"" page where you can mix and match the Mexican basics like tacos, burritos and enchiladas. Now when I go to a Mexican restaurant, I base my opinion of them on their carnitas. I have a special place in my heart (and stomach) for these succulent morsels of porky goodness, and if a place can get it done right then I'm sold and will gladly return. So I ordered the carnitas ($11.35) and I'm happy to say that it was spot on. The pork was extremely tender and oh-so flavorful. There's nothing fancy about this meat...little to no seasoning (maybe salt) and no sauce, so it's all about the quality of the meat and how it's cooked, and this was cooked perfectly. It was served with lettuce, pico, avocado wedges, refried beans, rice, half a lime and three flour tortillas. Everything went well together, and this was some of the best rice I've ever had...not crunchy or dry, but very moist. I took home extra rice and beans and will definitely be making a tasty omelet tomorrow morning with it!

My wife initially ordered the number 7 combo, which was an enchilada and chili relleno. When asked which meat she wanted, she ordered the chicken since she does not eat beef. This is where we encountered the only ""issue"" with the restaurant. Her chili relleno was not what we expected. In every other Mexican restaurant we've eaten in, from New York to Florida to Nevada, a chili relleno has always been the meat stuffed inside a full or half pepper. This was not what she got. Monterrey's version of a chili relleno is basically a ground beef ball smothered in cheese sitting atop one strip of green pepper. It wasn't so much the fact that the dish was prepared differently than usual, but that it was beef instead of chicken. We called the waitress over and I don't  think she initially understood what our problem was. Eventually my wife explained it enough times for her to understand, and the waitress suggested that my wife get a chicken taco and then she would just change the order to the enchilada/ taco combination. Her taco came out fairly quickly afterwards and it was good. Nothing fancy, but tasty. Her enchilada was likeways very tasty and cooked as you would expect a chicken enchilada to taste.

The total for the two of us came out to $26 and change, and after giving her the $20 Groupon we were left to pay $6 and change, plus tip. The food and drinks are cheap compared to other Mexican restaurants I've been to, the service was quick and friendly, and the one problem we had was resolved in the end, though it took some explaining for the waitress to understand what the issue was. The price, quantity, and quality of food and service are both flippin' sweet and I would highly recommend going here to get your Mexican on. We'll definitely be checking out other Mexican restaurants nearby, but I'll totally be coming back here again someday soon.",4481,2

Yes, I have stayed here twice before and I remember how dingy it used to be - but this is no longer the case. They have put in new carpets in the rooms and the hallways, and the room and bathroom are decked out with new wallpapers, marble countertops, and tasteful furniture/linens. The fitness center has newer, higher-end machines, and the pool area was completely deserted (perhaps because I stayed on a Thursday night and not over the weekend). The only thing I can agree with the previous reviewers is that the walls still seem to be a little thin, but luckily my neighbors were considerate of others and were not loud at all. The only way I could tell they were thin was because I could hear it every time someone flushed the toilet. I think the hotel now deserves the 3.5-star rating and I would definitely stay here again.",3743,1

The spicy shrimp tacos with black beans and a mojito, of course. My friend had the steak fajita that smelled scrupmtious. His 'house' margarita' was odd tasting but not awful.

294,5,"I am from California. I stayed in downtown Montreal for 10 days with my baby during my husband's business trip. 

My 17 months old baby was not eating much since he has been eating mainly Korean food at home. 

I searched for Korean food on Yelp and found this place and decided to walk from Hyatt Regency hotel. I want to say it was 20 minutes of walk. Or less. I donno. I also stopped by the Fountain Park.

I got to this place with a stroller and a kind looking lady opened the door for me so i can bring the stroller in. 

I immediately ordered a soy bean paste soup called DenJangJJiKye. I asked the lady to make it super mild since my baby was going to eat this.

She brought in a miso soup for my baby to taste. I thought that was very kind of her. She then brought rolled up egg for my baby to win over the waiting time. Unfortunately he is allergic to eggs so i had to refuse but that was very nice of her to offer. 

My baby literally finished one full bowl of rice with soup. Yes one bowl. A 17 months old baby. 

I tasted the soup and it was pretty good. 
Californians are known to be spoiled with many varieties of foods. You can pretty much get anything you want within 5 minutes vicinity; good ones, too. Maybe i did not expect too much but it was pretty good. Could be better tho, but it did the job for my baby and thats all i needed.

It happened......I ate.....and I ate.....and I ate some more. The wait to pay for the food takes a very very long time so your patience will be tested.

You can choose from sushi, carnitas, chicken, pasta, and more. The selection of choices is endless here and the food is AMAZING! I ate 2 plates and I was dunzo. My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I was OK with that. It was a glorious night that ended with this spectacular meal. 

If I had time I would've gotten some dessert because everything looked delish. I will definitely have to come back for more next time I am here. Just lots of good vibes here.

I can't believe my good fortune that they moved into the Town & Country in my 'hood. I came after a doctor's appt because I was starving from fasting. 

I sat at the bar and was immediately greeted by the friendly bartender. Another lady saw my bandage from having blood drawn and was considerate enough to ask me if I wanted a piece of toast or something. I ended up ordering a ""flight"" of pancakes where you can order 1 of 3 different flavors. Whoever decided to offer that option is, in my opinion, a brilliant person. I also love that they have such distinct and interesting pancake options. I ended up noshing on carrot cake (which ended up being the fave), sweet potato and a ""pancake of the day"" which had chocolate chips and cherries. I got a side of the house-made chicken sausage which was amazing. I'm not sure what herbs they seasoned with but it looks like a pounded, cubed steak. But it was very moist and not too salty. 

I've only been back there another time since and I exercised the half and half option for their ""art of hollandaise"" items. Another great option! I got to try two kinds of but the winner was the Havana Benny. Here's the description: Shaved Niman Ranch ham and slow roasted pork served over a savory Swiss cheese bread pudding and topped with poached eggs, Dijon hollandaise and diced house pickles. The ham was really the winning ingredient here but all of it came together nicely. 

I noticed this place draws a varying demographic. I saw families with kids and grandmas like one would see at IHOP. But I also saw hipsters on the patio and at the bar.

We arrived and were say down quickly. Happy with the table, but when I looked around I would have been happy at any of the tables. Nothing like a bad table to disrupt a pleasurable meal.

The waiter introduced several options and discussed with us the farms and different types of beef. I chose the sirloin on the bone  with a beer and chips. I probably could have gone the red wine and salad, but hey, some times you feel like steak, chips and a beer!  :)

The steak took about 30 minutes to cook and bring out, which was understandable given the size of the thing!

The steak was absolutely delicious ... To die for incredible. I only expect beef like this to come out of countries and restaurants in the States, South Africa or Argentina.

The service, was fantastic also, with the gentlemen serving us being attentive, courteous and knowledgeable.

I will make one small complaint, however it doesn't register enough for a drop in a star. An irritant I found was spending £50 on a steak and then being asked to pay £2 for a relatively small amount of sauce. I found this quite cheapening.",7074,3

First off, let me say that they have the best menudo in Phoenix, either red or white, and it is available every day, whereas most Mexican places will only have it available on weekends.  The menudo actually tastes homemade, not like it was just poured out of a can and reheated.  As far as the rest of their dishes, they also have a variety of tasty platters, such as different kinds of tacos, enchiladas, and ""burros"" (not burritos.... but the actual correct term of a big Mexican wrap; the term ""giant"" or ""big"" burrito is actually a contradiction or an oxymoron, but anyway I digress... back to the review!).  They also have chips and salsa, both the red and green variety.

The food is actually tasty and flavorful, unlike many of the other ""-berto's"" fast food Mexican places all around town, which for the most part, is bland and all tastes the same. Sure, it might be a bit unfair for me to make that comparison, since Rosita's is a restaurant and not a fast food joint.  And I'm not saying Filiberto's or Julioberto's or any of those other place are bad.  But what I'm saying is that I am willing to drive far just to eat out here at Rosita's, which is what the difference is.

I was only able to have a piece.  Most steaks here are aged for 30-60 days, but the Riserva could be aged anywhere from 6-11month!! You'll never taste anything like it.  Chances are it won't be available, but demand it anyways! 

Dry Aged Steaks: As time process two things changed in the meat. Moisture evaporates from the muscle which creates a greater concentration of the beefy flavor.  Secondly, the enzymes break down muscle tissue, and as the result you're left with a more tender beef.  Keep in mind this aging process require lots of space and also time consuming. Not to mention there are significant weight reduction in the beef, therefor not many steak house are offering this approach.  

*tip* If you're lucky to get this off-menu item,  request it not to be sliced up. This way you don't have to rush to eat it as the beef's oily texture turns kind of waxy rather quickly. If you're sharing have them distribute the meat evenly among your friends.  

Not into all that jazziness??  Dry Aged Ribeyes are exquisite in their own rights.  All steaks are rubbed with sea salt, black pepper, and fresh rosemary prior to cooking for a nice thin char. However, the Riserva are cooked with neighboring broilers to prevent from crusting.  Steaks are then cut table side and before serving dressed with a little olive oil and a dash of maldon salt.  

Whatever you choose to get keep in mind that this going to be a heavy meal, so pick your sides and apps accordingly.  In fact skip appetizers and the bread offering with the salted butter and bacon butter all together.  Just go straight for the goods with some sides like the Mascarpone and Guanciale Mashed Potatoes. For every 2 people I highly encourage your party split a serving of the meat.  And if you're still hungry after that?? L'America!!!",1228,3
514,5,"I'm glad I took the trip here on my first day in the Phoenix area. It took me a while looking around to find a restaurant to go to and this place certainly made the effort worthwhile. In fact, I believe this is a must-go place if you are ever visiting Phoenix or its surrounding suburbs. 

Location and ambiance:
It's located in the Heritage Park, so your car actually cannot get anywhere close to the building. You can either do street parking or park in the heritage garage, which I think at least a part of it gets validated (at least that's what it seemed like when the server asked me while i was paying whether or not i parked in the garage). I did street parking and walked through the park, which was rather enjoyable. I didn't find the actual restaurant ambiance all that impressive though but i guess you cant do much when it's inside a historic building. 

Food:
I had an idea of what i wanted to order when i checked their website, but both fortunately and unfortunately, it turned out to be restaurant week in Arizona (yes apparently all of arizona had restaurant week at the same time) and the selection was limited to the restaurant week menu ($40 for three courses) and a otherwise rather dismal selection of the original dinner menu. I had wanted to have the Washyugyu short rib, but they only offered this waguyu beef that wasn't offered as a part the prix fixe menu, and there was nothing on this menu to pair it with, so knowing that their portions are small, i had to go with the fixed price menu, which turned out to be quite good.

They start you out with a mixed plate of SNAP PEAS, SHASITO PEPPERS, HOUSE KIMCHI, and a GAZPACHO type SOUP. The kimchi was my favourite, than the soup. The rest were okay.

For my first course, I chose the SHIROMI CARPACCIO, which was a white sashimi fish that is served with hot flavoured oil poured on top in front of you and paird with house-made foccacia. The flavour of the oil includes ""ginger, yuzu kosho, sesame oil, garlic"" and their faccacia is fused with herb. Together, the combination really opens up your appetite. I dont like sashimi, but this I ate all. 

For the second course, I was suggested the LOBSTER ROLL, since it's not often on their menu. To be honest, I was a tiny bit disappointed since I was promised that it was going to be phenomenal and I got just very good. The lobster roll had minimal mayonnaise (which is good IMO) but it also had more vegetables than lobster. What I did find amazing was that although there appeared to be a lot of celery in there, the flavour did not overcome the dish and you barely taste the celery, just the crunchy texture. I wasn't a fan of the lukewarm sweet bread in place of a real roll. It also comes with a tiny bowl of bisque, which is the sauce they seem to use in the roll as well. The bisque was mediocre, but the fresh chives really added flavour to the whole thing. 

For the last course, dessert, I got the japanese pastry mix, which came with a BLACK SESAME BRULEE, ORANGE MOUSSE, and a CREAM PUFF. I generally don't like the black sesame flavour, but the brulee was so good I ate every last bite. The Orange mousse was served in an orange peel. At first bite it was a bit too tangy, but the more you ate, the better it taste. It also helped that there were pulp inside the mousse, which gave it amazing texture. I saved the cream pouf for last because it was my favourite. It was your average cream puff but carved in a way that looks like a picnic basket, and served with fresh strawberries , which really kicked the puff up a notch. 

I loved the fact that this place can take a regular japanese dish and kick it up a notch by adding such simple things. 

Service:
My main server was okay. She wasn't all that nice, but was helpful in suggestions as she took my order. There were 3-4 people that served dishes, took my bill, etc., and they were all extremely friendly and made you feel really welcome. The host who ended up taking my bill was very chatty with me and thanked me for dropping by on my first day in Phoenix. 

I really hope to come back again in the next few days.",3403,3
518,5,"My mom and I actually had dinner plans with a big group of family at another restaurant, but we were tired and hungry from shopping so we stopped in for drinks and appetizers. Her pear martini was unbelievable: so fresh, not too sweet, and garnished with a slice of pear on top. I had a Moscow mule, which was tasty but nothing special. However, the real star was the appetizer. We went with the cheese board, and it was incredible (and $20): three kinds of cheese, apples, walnut toast, a few jams and some honey. 

The pizza also looked great, and the fries with garlic aioli. I wish we could have gone back for a full meal. However, be careful because the prices add up: our two drinks plus a cheese board was almost $50 total. A splurge, but worth it!",260,3

579,5,"My goodness greasy, burn yo finger chicken. 

These are the kinds of places I miss from LA. Over there, the food was proper and the hospitality is abundant....it's been a long time, but frankly my broken ass self can't add hypertension to the list of issues so it's a real treat to get some Southern comfort. 

I'm with everyone that the cornbread pancakes are love. I've had these once as a cornbread pigs in a blanket in a southern mommas home. These were better. It's nothing crazy creative, but it's simple goodness comfort at it's finest. 

I had a white meat fried chicken plate with red beans and rice and collard greens. The chicken was juicy and I think the seasoning was good...slightly more salty than I normally like, but I'm not big on salt. Once I dipped in a side of gravy and hot sauce though, it was all good. Muddy water to wash it down was perfect. Red beans and rice is basic and decent, collard greens were decent. 

BF got the chicken and waffles. The waffles were interesting since they were shaped like a hot dog bun and the batter was a cinnamon batter. We thought the waffle was good alone, but that the sweet waffle got a bit too much after a while. I prefer plain waffles with chicken. I want to get these waffles for breakfast though.

We brought the BF's mom and grandma and they had a chicken plate and meatloaf. Both were very happy with it and it got the approval that they said there will be a ""next time"". The BF would like to say that he feels this is the best chicken he's had and that he wants the 5 star bump. Both his mom and he would like to add that neither are fried chicken people, but enjoyed it enough that they'd both want the chicken again. 

I'm saying this is good, solid fare, but it's not the absolute best Mississippi cooking I've had.....but I'd have to fly out to go get to my favorite food spot though. I felt the food after, but that isn't their fault my busted self indulged in fatty chicken and salts. Worth it though- drinking plenty of water to flush it out. 4 stars for the food.

With me, the 5 star bump is definitely because of the staff. We walked in and the owner greeted us enthusiastically. Our server was sweet and our service was attentive. Our server even offered to pull me up a to-go muddy water since everyone was finished with foods, but I was still thirsty and took just a gulp to finish it off.  When our plates came except the BF's, the owner noticed and went up to the window to check up on the kitchen and promptly brought out his order. Gotta appreciate an owner who has a hand in the smooth operation. And speaking of the line, it's crazy how they kick it old school without any tickets and call out the order- the kitchen doesn't mess up orders much either. Food never sits longer than a few seconds on the pass so food is hot and fresh for everyone. Sure, it takes a while to get some foods, but it was busy and everything is fried up fresh. I'd be worried if it didn't take a moment to make since everything should be fresh....I think we're so used to fast foods that most people might think it's a long wait. 

Won't slap our mommas, but we'll bring em back!",559,3
593,5,"Wait staff are attentive. Drinks are about average price. I can't speak for the food itself, but the portions I saw were huge! The next time I'm in Cleveland, I will come here again!",6559,3
604,5,"Subtracting the Kim chi  roast pork toast since it wasn't my type but it isn't bad if that's your thing. 

The service we got from the waitress was above average and she took the time to guide us noobs trough the process. Though the weak among us would also need help to pull the chairs. They weigh a lot. 

The thing we ordered was the Belgian Waffle on a hot plate topped with fruits and chocolate milk tea ice cream. With green tea cream sauce on the side that is poured on top of the dish making a nice sizzling sound. 

The waffle and ice cream is very light I think you can eat three orders of this without feeling icky. 

The coffee milk tea ice cream had a hint of both flavours much better than most coffee tea mixes from the Chinese restaurants.

The price isn't too obscene. At $8.50 for the waffle dish it makes a good finisher for a dinner from elsewhere.

He is top notch grade A.  Great customer service, many apologies for my not so great experience at a completely differently location and I will make sure on my next visit to Fremont I will visit the Golden Nugget location just to say hello.  All managers should be as hospitable as he is.  Thx for all of your help!!!",3258,1
627,5,"Fresh is pretty much my favourite place to have a meal in Toronto, and has been since before I even moved here. A stunning array of food and drinks served without much wait, little to no pretention, at reasonable prices. Note: my review for the restaurant as a whole comes first regardless of location (as nothing varies wildly), and I have a specific note about this location right at the end.

* Food
- Let's talk about the miso gravy, people. It's like, ambrosia or something. I'm getting to the point where I can barely go there and order without somehow working in miso gravy to the mix. I think this will be my downfall one fateful brunch visit.
- A damn good range of stuff; want something light? Lots of apps and salad, plus daily soups! Something healthy and filling? Rice bowls! Want to go crazy? Burgers and wraps and why not fries too? (Sweet tater, thanksverymuch.)
- Portion sizes are EXCELLENT.
- Menu pretty useful and descriptive for what you get on your plate.
- Standard brunch options are great (pancake platter well worth $12), but also a great special each weekend.
- Fresh ingredients, a great mix of flavours - i've not met a dish there I didn't like, because they've all got their own thing goin' on, no blandness present. Even the burgers and rice bowls which are generally a variation on a theme have something for everyone - i've got favourites and often have a hard time ordering outside my precious little clique of food.
- Desserts are generally offerings from Sweets From The Earth - I can't really say I ever have room for them after a main and a drink though! I could count on one hand these times, in fact. They must've had to roll me out of there.

* Drinks
- Mocha mint espresso shake and I have a monogamous thing going on; I don't even see the rest of the shake menu when I catch his eye.
- Sheer wall of juice and smoothie options can be crazy - or you can go juice-lite and make your own combo
- Delicious espresso, latte is divine with any brunch.
- Soy *and* rice milks on offer 
- Beer and wine too, but I always lean toward the non-hard stuff here.

* Prices
- Look at your bill. Now look at your belly. Now back to the bill. Now back to your belly. I think you can justify what you're spending based on the fact you're about to have a food baby.
- In all seriousness though, this isn't Subway or Burger King - you are paying a cost that matches the quantity, quality and flavour of what just went in that round little belly. You're worth it.
- I think - including tax and tip - I generally get out of here no worse off than around $20 and i've had a meal and drink and can't possibly entertain the thought of ever eating again.

* Atmosphere
- Yes, it gets busy. 
- Yes, you're sitting right alongside people. This is probably not somewhere to go on a romantic date where you want to woo your lady or dude. 
- I honestly have never had a problem sitting in the groups of tables (booths are nice if you can get them) - on my own, or with a few people - it's never that loud or distracting that I feel like i'm actually sitting *with* the people next to me. If I felt weird about the way Fresh was set up I wouldn't keep going back - but each to their own, this is not going to be a place to go and eat for all occasions.
- On occasion i've found the music a tad loud, but it's generally a good background and helps blend the kitchen and chatter noise away into the background.

* Service
- Water brought to your table without having to ask
- They give you plenty of time to make your decision (especially with a menu that size) and are helpful if you have questions about anything.
- Attentive but never obsessively hovering around to bother/help.
- Generally not too hard on the eyes.

* Location
- Spadina: for some reason, on about 85% of the visits i've made to this location they've been out of avocado. What is up with that? I often find this to be the quieter location, although sometimes it can get randomly busy.",3169,3
628,5,"VIBE 
I love the Adelaide street location. If you walk by, you may miss it (but it's right beside Khao San Road).  

Really beautiful communal wooden table that I want for my kitchen right in the middle of the space and a lovely hidden outdoor patio in the back. It has a beautiful mural of a flower (or a sun?...sorry it's been a while since summer) but it brightens what would otherwise be a bland patio. The point is lots of room to eat. Helpful, friendly staff. 

I EAT 
I have been back for the mushroom porcini soup on more than one occasion. The apricot is ok...needs more flavour. But the lamb wrap steals the show. 

As others say, the combo is a great lunch deal for the quality and portion of food you're getting.

648,5,"I am feeling like an idiot because I ordered a chicken bowl with tortillas on the side - two small ones. I got to the cashier and was charged $1.25 per tortilla for $2.50 total. I was pretty upset because  I did not know they were extra, but agreed to pay for it since I ordered it anyway... 
The friendly cashier and manager comped me because of the confusion! So nice of them. I did not understand right away that they were comping my meal I thought they were just comping the tortillas so I stood there with my card out until the cashier told me again I was all good.

I got back to my office to find out I had ordered QUESADILLAS not tortillas! Oops. I was in such a rush to get lunch I ordered the wrong thing and that is why they charged me. 

I feel terrible now but I have to say that was very kind and great customer service. Everyone was friendly and it might sound strange but I was very happy that they drained the salsa before putting it on my bowl because  I hate when the salsa makes everything soggy. 

Very happy with the customer service here and I feel bad that I got a free meal when it was my mistake in the first place. I will definitely keep coming here, after all, I have to make up for my free meal with my patronage!",6139,2
657,5,"Late to the game again.  I've lived in Vegas since 1992 and just recently made my first visit to this spot that's a favorite with visitors and locals.  It looks like some kinda Miami Vice-inspired disco with all the purple and pink neon inside, but it also has waitresses who wear blue and white old-school uniforms and call you ""honey.""  The menu has something for everyone, which is a good thing since it's open 24/7 and you never know what you'll be craving in the wee hours.  
The first visit, I had an omelet which, upon ordering, I had no idea would be made with 10 whole eggs!  No wonder I couldn't even finish half.  The second visit the other day, I ordered the turkey club with fries and that was also a healthy portion, but I was able to finish most of it in one sitting.  There was some kind of mishap in the kitchen, though, with my dish taking the longest to arrive.  Our waitress was very good about getting the sandwich comped because of the delay and the head chef also came by our table to apologize.   
Depending on the time of day you come, there will be a wait, so be prepared since this is a popular place.  We ate lunch here two days ago on Friday, November 11th, at 12:30pm, and waited about 30 minutes.  Mind you, it was a holiday, so considering that, the line wasn't horrible.

Yay!

OK, actually I'm bi...I enjoy the occasional ""breakfast burrito"", but if I'm pressed to choose...I'll take the hole and the ""Old Fashioned Glazed"" that surrounds said hole.

That and a good cuppa.

And I would bathe in the coffee (and possibly the donut glaze) except for the inevitable ""dust-up"" that always occurs when I let my impulses run wild and free!

Don't get me wrong...the donuts are terrific and the nice young lady behind the counter was almost as sweet as the apple fritters.

I had a client meeting there this morning (I know, I spare no expense!), and my clients were just as charmed as I was with Rainbow...the great coffee, the terrific donuts and fritters and the pleasant service (not to mention free wi-fi for my meeting) all combine to make Rainbow Donuts a significant step above the rest.

Honestly certain people just don't know what good food is or just wants something to complain about. But if you're a foodie and you live to eat, then you would want to order EVERYTHING on their menu!!!

Let's face it, this restaurant is Japanese based, so just that right there should tell you it's not gonna be cheap.

Honestly though, I have never been disappointed here, if anything is that I could never try EVERYTHING on their menu....The Uni Tomato Cream Pasta is to die for!

770,5,"Disclaimer: The following Yelp is based solely on Salt of the Earth's cocktail program and the experience we had at the bar last Saturday night.

Trying to knock down as many craft cocktail bars that my liver allows since returning to Pittsburgh, I can't believe it's taken this long to get to Salt of the Earth. 

The 6-8-seat bar tucked away on the first floor is rather underwhelming and cramped relative to the rest of the spacious, inviting restaurant. The very trendy (and overrated) communal, cafeteria seating on the first floor lends to a boisterous environment that takes a few minutes for the ears to adjust. 

Upon finding two seats at the bar, I did my usual 'rye, bourbon, whisky' request. When the mixologist, Carissa, grabbed the bottle of Old Overholt, I knew I was home. I've been singing the praises of Pennsylvania style ryes for some time and it's nice to see a bar give them some respect. Carissa mixed up an original - Overholt, Aperol, maraschino bitters and few drops of absinthe (for aroma). It went down way too smooth. I normally drink cocktails that demand respect and bite back. With that said, her original cocktail was a nice way to start the evening.

A conversation about the legitimacy of Pennsylvania's Dad's Hat Rye gave way to an Old Fashioned. Although I'm on the fence with Dad's Hat, there was no joking about the way Carissa constructs an Old Fashioned! She's craftswoman dancing in my wheelhouse! 

However, the star cocktail of the evening was the simply noted Ginever - Wigle (Ginever), celery, apple, shiso. This cocktail is what defines the handcraft cocktail movement - take a unique, regional spirit and compliment it (not mask it) with locally grown or seasonal syrups, shrubs, reductions, and/or bitters It's different not for the sake of being different but because it is original and its components were given much thought. I'm still deconstructing what I drank starting with the local distillery (Wigle) and the thought of gin made from rye mash (Ginever or Dutch-style gin).",307,3

The secret to China Star is to order from the Chinese menu, not the white folks menu.  Or even better, order whatever is on the whiteboard when you come into the restaurant. 

Don't go in and order egg rolls and general Tso's chicken and expect it to be anything but mediocre.

DO order a flaming pan (especially the duck in beer if they have it).

Expect your face will be burnt off it you ask for it spicy.

My favorite dishes: Dry fried Chongquing chicken, mapo tofu, sauteed green beans with pork, spicy lamb in flaming pan, don don noodles and anything with bamboo shoots. 

The service is standard for a somewhat authentic Chinese restaurant.  Your waiter will not be around because it is expected that you will be there for a long time and that you will seek out your waiter if you need something.

794,5,"I came across this gem last weekend when I was looking at some of the local open houses.  I was walking down Queen St and in the distance I saw a sign that said bacon.  I started walking towards it, not taking my eyes off of the sign.  As I was getting closer the smell of bacon was in the air.
I opened the door it felt like I was in heaven, the sound and smell of bacon and eggs filled the room.  I walked up to the counter and looked at the menu.  There are around 9 different sandwiches to choose from, even a veggie option for you non meat eaters out there.  You can customize each sandwich by adding eggs, cheese and different sauces on top.  On Sat I decided to order the Bacon Butty with a fried egg on it.  Unfortunately I didn't have my camera with me to take some pics of it but I knew I would be back again.

So that brings us to this morning, I knew I wanted to go back to Rashers so I grabbed my camera and walked down Queen St. just west of Carlaw.  I talked to Colin (the man behind the counter) and asked him what the most popular sandwich was and he replied with a smile on his face ""definitely the Hogtown Sandwich"".  He explained to me what it was so I took his advice and ordered it with a fried egg and cheese on top.  This beast of a sandwich comes with 4 pieces of peameal bacon on a bun with homemade brown sauce, and like I said before you can add an egg and cheese.  You should be prepared that you need to be really hungry for this one.  This sandwich was so good, the gooey cheese with the salty peameal bacon, the fried egg dripping all over the soft bun and a nice sauce to top it all off.  It was delicious.

Rashers is a bit of a small place so there are only 5-6 seats to sit down at.  I was lucky enough that some people were just leaving so I got to sit down.  The first thing I noticed was this poster of Bacon Facts on the wall  There are some very interesting facts, some I believe and some I don't, but anyways it's a nice touch.  Take a look for yourself and tell me what you think.  The next thing I noticed on a wall was a portrait of Kevin Bacon, you know from the hit movie Tremors and many other award winning films.  I actually laughed out loud, because it's not a typical portrait, he's dressed up like renaissance man from the 1500′s.
Rashers might be a bit tight but that's ok, you don't need to be there for long, you eat and go.  It's a place where you stop by for a quick bite and you continue on with your day.

796,5,"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Katrina M. took me here after I was getting homesick. I have been back almost every week if only to walk around and read the Korean. I love supermarkets. Maybe it is the fact that we all need food to survive and food has always been a source of comfort. Walking around a supermarket in any country I visit is almost as important as seeing a landmark. It speaks more about the people of that area than any other culture center.

The pre-made food section offers a wide selection of banchan (Korean side dishes). I haven't tried any yet, because I am still in the stage of wanting to make my own. I have 8lb. of kimchi sitting in my fridge as proof. Thank you Greenland for stocking all the essential ingredients. ^_^v 

I have bought their bulgogi since my friends were too impatient to wait for me to marinate my own. I liked it, I would only add some onions, enoki mushrooms, and green onions to give it a little contrast to the sweetness of the sauce. 

The japchae (sesame clear sweet potato noodles with vegetables) was also decent. A little sweeter than I am used to, but it is decent if you add some black pepper and slices of green chili peppers.",4174,3
837,5,"A Slice Above where have you been all my CLE life?  
Ok, it's probably me, but how. did. I. Not. know. about. YOU!?

I ordered 2 pies (Medium) which came to approx. $24; this isn't bad because aside from the big box 'za places, this is comparable in price and for what you get, I think it is a pretty good deal.

Pie 1 - Pepperoni Feast - Slice Above Crust, regular sauce, added garlic slices. 
Pie 2 - Pesto - Whole wheat crust.

They made an error with my order and instead of the pepperoni feast I got the Death By Pepperoni which essentially added bacon to my pie, plus more pepperoni and cheese.  I like bacon, so I didn't care.

The verdict: The 'za was fresh, delish, and well made.  They certainly didn't skimp on the toppings either.  The whole wheat crust was dense and slightly sweet, but not annoyingly so.  The regular crust was perfect, not too thick, not too thin.  Finally 'za worthy of my taste buds!

A few things that could be worked on:
1. The website.  It doesn't work for all the links
2. The website ordering - you can't add notes to your order.  (Ex. I wanted my 'za ready at a later time.  I couldn't include that info on online ordering so I had to call it in.)
3. The website - The menu isn't accurate (Ex. The Pepperoni Feast is not the 'za that is described.)

For those of you who know what Mellow Mushroom is, this might even be better, In My Opinion.  
I like it, I'll be back!",6806,3
845,5,"Taste of home! We had chicken joy, spaghetti, palabok, and peach mango pie. Everything was pretty good, and the price was decent. The only thing I found that could be better was increase the number per bucket. I think each bucket contained only 6 pcs, so we ended up having to order 2 buckets (there were 5 of us) just in case. Service was pretty good. We got our food right away.",2933,3
867,5,"The thought of ever sitting in a sticky, stinky, over filled Harkins again makes me want to cry.  iPic has ruined all other theaters for me. 
First off, these seats are huge.  Sorry fly boys, that yawn move isn't going to work here. Copping a feel would be serious work.  And to the 10 year old in every R rated movie I go to way past their bed times, your parent's poor decisions wont effect me tonight.  Unless your wearing stilts no way are you kicking the back of my seat.
Over priced soda.  No thanks, I'll take a glass of wine, or the complimentary sodas they offer.  Stale popcorn, uh none for me thanks, fresh popped and free!  But save room for the extensive menu they offer.  
Was it pricey? Yes.
Is it worth it? Absolutely.

Oh, and there's a soft fluffly blanket sitting on the seat for each guest.  Nice touch, ipic, very nice touch.",627,1
889,5,"I have been to many Japanese restaurants, but as a Japanese 
I think this restaurant serves the best Japanese food
in this country so far.

We ordered nigiri, rolls, robata yaki and so on.
Everything was great. Their chawanmushi was okay, but 
I would give them a credit for just having this not-so-major-dish 
on their menu.

They have their own tea collection which is $30 per pot. 
Since I grew up with the real Japanese tea in Japan,
I did not find their tea so special to be $30 but this is the only
thing I can think of as something negative.
Otherwise the food, service, view, and the decoration of the 
restaurant was all phenomenal.",4096,3
903,5,"I was in Vegas for the night, and had called my cousin out for dinner. We had initially wanted to go Italian, but at the last minute decided that Thai was a better option. The window sticker suggests that this is the best Thai food in town, and leaves room to wonder whether it really is. We started with the fresh spring rolls, and ordered pineapple fried rice w/ shrimp, spicy eggplant (which they label as eggplant spicy) w/ tofu, pad pak w/ chicken, and the pad kapow w/ beef. 

To start, the spring rolls were rolled with a non traditional rice sheet, and were not made with the usual ingredients. Even the peanut sauce seemed a bit lacking. The spicy eggplant had just enough grease to make it delish, and the fried rice was to die for. I barely touched the pad pak, and almost steered clear of the pad kapow - like eating mashed up beef patties. Despite the less favorable dishes, I am still craving me some Archi's!",7163,2
957,5,"Food is always good, tried new flavor, cherry sting, it's good. There are plenty of TV's to watch 'the game' and the servers are very attentive, but, tonight there was way too much 'attention'!

We've seen their captains before, going around introducing themselves, asking if they can get us anything, making sure we are having a good time etc.....  But, there ste times when you just want to eat the wings and watch the game without all the goodhearted interuptions!

Not only was our server eager to share her visit back home for the Thanksgiving holiday and reunion with her military boyfriend, but she stopped by about a dozen times asking if 'you guys are ok', plus two captains made the rounds as well as the manager? For a couple that just wanted wings and to watch ULNV/ASC game, we were interupted way too much!

So, expect a lot of attention when you go. Food is good, service is good, games are good, when you're not interupted! Maybe they should consider a 'no bother' sign to flip when service isn't needed!",2126,3
970,5,"I would have never known about this Hong Kong Chinese restaurant unless the waitress at Saigon Pho ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/saigon-pho-chandler#hrid:K7dcALr_WARav3-SqLC4LA ) hadn't recommended it! Kudos to her! We discovered that the waitress had virtually the same taste in Chinese cooking as my sister and myself! She even liked Wong's  Place ( http://www.yelp.com/biz/wongs-place-tempe#hrid:r9k_c5ki5lhCkm9wOsj8Hg ) on Baseline in Tempe. Tonight we decided on her recommendation of Hong Kong Asian Diner.

Stuffed Meat To-Fu (*** 1/2 $5.95) The most subtle tasting entree that we had this evening. We probably should not have ordered it along with the Fish Ball entree, Salty Fish Fried Rice or Singapore Vermecelli. Our fault, not the restaurant's! The flavor was very subtle. You will see a slab of Tofu cut into eight thick squares... each Tofu square is topped with a piece of Shrimp and liberally sprinkled with small Peanut chunks. Chinese Broccoli flanked the sides of the Tofu, which was immersed in a White Gravy. Nice looking presentation.

Sizzling Black Bean Sauce Fish Balls (***** $7.95) There is some problem in translation with this entree. The ""Fish Balls"" are actually Filet of Fish... not the Fish Balls you'd associate with Pho! The problem is the absolute direct translation from the Chinese lettering on the menu. The Filets are sauteed in a Black Bean Brown Gravy along with Green and Red Peppers and big chunks of Onions. We enjoyed this a lot!

Salty Fish / Chicken Fried Rice (***** $7.95) Unlike other traditional Cantonese restaurants, the Chicken is fried golden brown (before being added to the Fried Rice), along with bigger chunks of Salty Fish to create this Fried RIce! This was one of the dishes unanimously voted best of the evening! Proviso - I hesitate in recommending this Fried Rice to non-Asians, as Salty Fish is an acquired taste.

Singapore Vermecelli (***** $7.95) Hong Kong Asian Diner's innovation in this staple Egg Noodle dish is the addition of a lot of Ground Black Pepper, sprinkled profusely on top of the prepared Noodles! It seems like, even though I order this all the time, this was the first time my sister and my friend ever had Singapore Vermecelli. Singapore Vermecelli is a Egg Noodle dish fried with Barbeque Pork and Shrimp and bits of Chicken, also with Green Pepper, Eggs, and Onions, spiced with Curry. Because of the use of Curry, Singapore Vermecelli has been confused as a tropical item from the island of Singapore... when in actuality it's strictly of Chinese origin. Delicious!

Pot of Hot Tea
Sliced Valencia Oranges afterwards.

Nice presentation of each entree, especially the Salty Fish Fried Rice and Singapore Vermecelli. You might have a problem with communication... as there is a definite lack of knowledge of English in this restaurant... from the translation in the menus to the wait-staff.

There are many Lunch Specials under $6... but you will be disappointed if you don't order off the strictly Chinese Menu even with the bad English translation! Attempts at being a little bit more upscale than your typical Chinese restaurant. Demographics at 9pm: 40% of capacity, 90% Oriental customers.

A definite 5-star Chinese restaurant in the Valley! Not just a Cantonese restaurant... but a Hong Kong Cantonese restaurant. Perform some research on the Internet before coming through the door.",5758,2
971,5,"Drove by several times without really realizing exactly what it was.  After going to their movie theater, I will never go back to normal chain theaters near me.  Seats recline and are very comfortable.  Food is decent, and remarkably cheap for a movie theater setting.  Kids meal is only $5 or $6 and includes pizza, drink and cookie.  Also have $5 Tuesday which makes this a very affordable family outing.  Favorite part is that I can pick seats prior to purchase, so I don't have to worry about getting there an hour ahead of schedule for new releases.",2317,3
